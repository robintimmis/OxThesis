\section{A plan}
I am imagining I want an entire short chaper on this, there are many bits I woud like to include 
two broad parts
hyades and smilei
smielei being the main part. For now just writing up the BW module.

HHHHMMMM actually no I am not sure about this, perhaps Ill put in the introduction and just mention in the code section about its implementation.

\subsection{Smilei}
