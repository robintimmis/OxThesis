\section{A plan}

While simulations are relatively cost effective and experiments cumbersome and technically challenging, the proliferation of errors in simulation codes lead to their deviation from reality while reality itself deviates from the idealistic input conditions to the codes. At least for these first few decades of the 21st Century, experimentation remains an essential component of the scientific method. Thus, our expectations must also be scaled back to reality. This chapter reports on our March 2023 experiment on the ORION laser facility, AWE, Aldermaston. The UK's most powerful sub-picosecond laser. Yet, one cannot access the ZVP parameter space at these intensities and pulse durations: the $S$ parameter is too large and the preplasma scale length too steep. Instead, this chapter will focus on the ROM model of HHG.

Important sections include:
HYADES scale length sims, ORION parameters and description of the setup, targets etc, data analysis after, beamlet sims, HHG theory


I think the appropriate order would be theory, simulation, experiment layout, data analysis since then I can use all things inferred from theory and simulation to justify the data analysis. It also means ending well.

The early developments in the field are outlined by Teubner \textit{et al} \cite{teubnerHighorderHarmonicsLaserirradiated2009}.

%`The first experimental observations of femtosecond high-order harmonics were made independently by Kohlweyer et al. 􏰀1995􏰁 and von der Linde et al. 􏰀1995􏰁'

HHG from solids has demonstrated significantly higher conversion efficiencies than for HHG from gases nor are there any limitations to the applied laser intensity \cite{teubnerHighorderHarmonicsLaserirradiated2009}. SHHG has thus been a field of huge interest over the past three decades for the production of bright coherent attosecond harmonics.

\section{\label{ch:3-sec:theory}Theory}




\subsection{The ROM model}
% TODO Bourdier methodology in introduction

Apply Bourdier method and conservation of generalised momentum, we see that 

and thus non-linearity

and thus the thing we need to solve is blah.


The laser pulse leads to macroscopic oscillation of the plasma surface and therefore a corresponding oscillation of the ARP. One can understand this leading to a sub cycle Doppler shift in the reflected pulse. These pulses of radiation separated by the laser pulse frequency must therfore in the spectral domain consist of HH.

The \ac{ROM} model describes an extension. 

The following outlines the key ideas 

Ok: assume I have the expression from Baeva's paper (do this tomorrow)

\subsection{The normalisation factor}
Baeva's theory provides us with the relative intensity of harmonics. However, for comparison with the absolute spectral intensity of harmonics in experiment, the normalisation factor is required. This can be calculated from conservation of energy. For arbitrary harmonic order scaling, $n^{-p}$, the spectral intensity of the harmonic beam is
\begin{equation}
	I_\omega(\omega) = \frac{dE_\omega(J)}{dAd\omega} = I_0 \sum^{n_\mathrm{C}}_{n = 1,\ \mathrm{odd}} n^{-p} S_n\left( \frac{\omega}{\omega_\mathrm{L}}-n\right)
\end{equation}
up to the cutoff, $n_\mathrm{C}$. Here $S_n(\omega/\omega_\mathrm{L}-n)$ is the spectral shape function of the $n^\mathrm{th}$ harmonic in reciprocal space and $I_0$ is the normalisation factor of interest. From conservation of energy,
\begin{equation}
	\int I_\omega(\omega) \mathrm{d}\omega \mathrm{d} A = ER,
\end{equation}
% TODO Simulation showing long pulse vs short pulse spectral shape functions relative sizes
where $E$ the total energy of the laser pulse and $R$ is the reflectivity of the \ac{RPM}. Intuition suggests the spectral shape function for the $n^\mathrm{th}$ harmonic retains the spectral shape of the incident laser pulse, \textit{i.e.} for a laser pulse with a Gaussian temporal profile, this corresponds to a Gaussian centred at $n\omega_\mathrm{L}$ of width $\sigma_\mathrm{L} = 1/t_\mathrm{L}$, where $t_\mathrm{L}$ is the laser pulse width. Simulations show this is a reasonable approximation for ORION parameters \footnote{Hole boring discussed in the following section can lead to a Doppler shift in harmonic energy across the laser pulse corresponding to a Doppler broadening of the spectral shape function in reciprocal space, however, unlike the ZVP simulations of the previous chapter, this is negligible for ORION parameters.}.

Simulations also show that for the SP1 laser, the incident laser pulse significantly suppresses the even harmonics, hence,
\begin{equation}
	ER = \int^\infty_0 I_0 \sum^{n_\mathrm{C}}_{n=1,\ \mathrm{odd}}n^{-p}e^{-(\omega/\omega_\mathrm{L} - n)^2/\sigma^2_\mathrm{L}}\mathrm{d}\omega.
\end{equation}
The integral and summation order can be reversed. Since $\sigma_\mathrm{L} \ll \omega_\mathrm{L}$, all integrals in the summation are $\approx \int^\infty_{-\infty}$ and therefore,
\begin{equation}
	ER \approx I_0 \sum^{n_\mathrm{C}/2-1}_{m=0} (1+2m)^{-p} \sqrt{\pi}\sigma_\mathrm{L}\omega_\mathrm{L},
\end{equation}
thus,
\begin{equation}
	ER \approx I_0 \sqrt{\pi}\sigma_\mathrm{L}\omega_\mathrm{L} ((1-2^{-p})\zeta(p) - 2^{-p}\zeta(p,\frac{n_\mathrm{C} + 1}{2})),
\end{equation}
where $\zeta(p)$ and $\zeta(p,(n_\mathrm{C} + 1)/2)$ are the Riemann Zeta and Hurwitz Zeta functions respectively. The final term can be neglected for a petawatt class laser pulse where $n_\mathrm{C} \gg 1$. In the case of an ideal $p$-polarised laser pulse,
\begin{equation}
	ER \approx I_0 \sqrt{\pi}\sigma_\mathrm{L} \omega_\mathrm{L}\zeta(p).
\end{equation}
For the \ac{ROM} regime, $p = 8/3$ and the \ac{RPM} is extremely efficient, $R \approx 1$. Thus, $I_0$ can be estimated from the system parameters.

\subsection{Hole boring}
% TODO add reference to ZVP plots demonstrating hole boring.
As observed in the ZVP plots, on long timescales relative to the laser pulse cycles, via the ponderomotive pressure of the laser, the plasma front moves inwards. This is hole boring \cite{wilksAbsorptionUltraIntenseLaser1992}. One can derive a hole boring velocity by considering conservation of momentum in this quasi-static state. Since the hole boring velocity is laser pulse intensity dependent, the spatial profile of the laser will be imprinted on the surface. Typically Gaussian in shape, for high power laser systems, this can to first order generate a focusing \ac{RPM} and a beaming of the specularly reflected signal, as in Figure \ref{fig:orionholeboring}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/orion/orion_hole_boring}
	\caption[2D PIC simulation of HHG beaming effect via hole boring.]{Electromagnetic field intensity in a 2D PIC simulation of a relativistic ($a_0 = 30$) laser pulse incident on a solid density plasma. The incoming beam is specularly reflected off the target which is curved by the radiation pressure leading to beaming in the reflected harmonic beam.}
	\label{fig:orionholeboring}
\end{figure}
To access the highest possible electromagnetic field intensities, the laser pulse is focused on target to the diffraction limit. However, since the diffraction limit scales linearly with the wavelength, higher-order harmonics can be refocused to a smaller spot via this mechanism allowing access to unprecedented peak intensities. Vincenti \textit{et al} demonstrated intensity gains of over 1000 with currently accessible parameters in \ac{3D} \ac{PIC} simulations \cite{vincentiAchievingExtremeLight2019}, suggesting a realistic route to the Schwinger Limit using next-generation laser facilities. Regardless of any blue-skies purposes, it is clear any prediction of \ac{HHG} beam intensity must account for hole boring and is therefore an essential component of the ORION experiment analysis.

% TODO I might want to flesh out the hole boring analysis but it already takes up so much space so idk...
Applying momentum balance between the laser pulse and particles in the rest frame of the \ac{RPM} surface, the hole boring velocity is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:v_HB}
	\frac{v_\mathrm{HB}}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R\cos\theta}{2}\frac{Zm_\mathrm{e}}{Am_\mathrm{p}}\frac{n_\mathrm{c}}{n_\mathrm{e}(x_\mathrm{i}(t,y))}}a_L(t,y) = \Pi a_L(t,y),
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the RPM reflectivity, $\theta$ is the angle of incidence, \qty{16}{\degree} in the ORION experiment, $Z$ and $A$ are the atomic and atomic mass numbers respectively for the plasma ions, $n_\mathrm{c}$ is the plasma critical density, $n_\mathrm{e}(x_\mathrm{i}(t,y))$ the electron number density and $x_\mathrm{i}(t,y)$
the depth of hole boring, from the Supplementary Material \cite{vincentiOpticalPropertiesRelativistic2014}. For the ORION laser pulse parameter space $\Pi \ll a_\mathrm{L}\forall t$ , \textit{i.e.} we are in the relativistic electron and non-relativistic ion regime. Hence, the relativistic correction derived by Robinson \textit{et al} \cite{robinsonRelativisticallyCorrectHoleboring2009} to Equation \ref{eq:v_HB} can be neglected. Due to the high contrast and long duration of the ORION beamlines, there is minimal pre-plasma formation on the front surface and therefore the number density is simply the number density of the material in solid form and $n_\mathrm{e}$ is independent of $x_\mathrm{i}(t,y)$. Robinson \textit{et al} \cite{robinsonHoleboringRadiationPressure2009} generalised momentum conservation to multiple species, simply replace the mass density with the composite mass density $\rho = \sum_j m_{\mathrm{i}j}n_{\mathrm{i}j}$, then
\begin{equation}
	\frac{An_\mathrm{e}}{Z} \to \sum_j \frac{A_jn_{\mathrm{e}j}}{Z_j},
\end{equation}
where $n_{\mathrm{e}j}$ is the number density of electrons that originated from the $j$ ion.


%TODO (This analysis can be done by taking the Vincenti 2014 derivation and taking $R =1$, since that applied to ORION parameter space, replace ion terms with sums over ions and make the important assumption: all ions reflected at the same velocity (reasonable), note that this might be a tricky to do to electrons when there is significant electron heating and so $R < 1$, may need to return to this for thesis... manipulating the expression arrives at the desired form)

The spatio-temporal envelope of the normalised vector potential of the laser pulse incident on the target surface is modelled as
\begin{equation}
	a_\mathrm{L}(t,y) = a_0e^{-\frac{y^2}{2w_\mathrm{L}^2}}g(t-t_0)
\end{equation}
where $w_\mathrm{L}$ is the beam waist on target and $g(t)$ the temporal envelope, a Gaussian or $\sech$ profile and $t_0$ the main pulse peak time.

Integrating Equation \ref{eq:v_HB},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:xi_t}
	x_\mathrm{i}(y) = \int v_\mathrm{HB}\mathrm{d}t = \Pi \int^t_{-\infty} a_L(t,y)c\mathrm{d}t.
\end{equation}

At the peak of the main pulse,
\begin{equation}
	x_\mathrm{i}(y) = \Pi a_0ce^{-\frac{y^2}{2w_L^2}} G,
\end{equation}
where $G = \int_\infty^{t_0} g(t-t_0) \mathrm{d} t \sim t_\mathrm{L}$ and $t_\mathrm{L}$ is the laser pulse temporal width.

The total denting is a combination of the peak electron-ion charge separation, $x_\mathrm{e}$ (which leads to the intrinsic phase of the HHG beam \cite{anderbruggePropagationRelativisticSurface2007}) and Equation \ref{eq:xi_t}. Note that for the long pulse duration of the ORION laser, $x_\mathrm{i} \gg x_\mathrm{e}$ and therefore $x_\mathrm{e}$ can be neglected.

Applying a Taylor expansion to the spatial profile of Equation \ref{eq:xi_t} around the laser spot centre,
\begin{equation}
	x_\mathrm{i} = \mathrm{constant} - \frac{y^2}{4f_\mathrm{p}} + \mathcal{O}(y^4),
\end{equation}
where, to first order, this is the equation of a parabolic mirror with focal length
\begin{equation}
	f_\mathrm{p}(t) = \frac{w_\mathrm{L}^2}{4\Pi a_0cG}.
\end{equation}

Following the Vincenti \textit{et al} derivation \cite{vincentiOpticalPropertiesRelativistic2014}, the denting parameter is defined as,
\begin{equation}
	\delta_\mathrm{T} =  x_\mathrm{i}|_{(y=0)} - x_\mathrm{i}|_{(y=\sqrt{2}\omega_\mathrm{L})}.
\end{equation}
Hence,
\begin{equation}
	\delta_\mathrm{T} = \frac{w_\mathrm{L}^2}{2f_\mathrm{p}} = 2\Pi a_0 c G,
\end{equation}
and is independent of laser focal spot size. 

If the spatial profile of the $n^\mathrm{th}$ harmonic beam can be adequately described by a Gaussian at the plasma mirror plane, with a beam width described by the harmonic source size, $w_n$,
\begin{equation}
	h_n \sim e^{-r^2/w_n^2},
\end{equation}
then the beam profile is known at all distances, $z$ from the target. Its divergence, defined as 
\begin{equation}
	\theta_n = \lim_{z\to\infty} \frac{w_n(z)}{z},
\end{equation}
is therefore
\begin{equation}
	\theta_n = \theta^0_n\sqrt{1+\Psi^2_n},
\end{equation}
where $\theta^0_n = \lambda_n/\pi w_n$ is the harmonic divergence in the absence of RPM denting and
% TODO I think I need to give a bit more of this derivation.
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_n = \frac{2\pi}{\cos\theta}\left(\frac{w_n(0)}{w_L}\right)^2\frac{\delta_T}{\lambda_n}
\end{equation}
is the dimensionless focusing parameter. If $\Psi_n \gg 1$, as is true for the short wavelength X-ray harmonics of interest, 
\begin{equation}
	\theta_n \approx \frac{w_n(0)}{f_\mathrm{p}\cos\theta}
\end{equation}
and the divergence is dominated by RPM curvature. 

Far from focus, at the detector plane $z =$ 2.4 m from the target,
\begin{equation}
	w_{n} \approx z\tan\theta_n.
\end{equation}
The corresponding magnification factor at detection is thus 
\begin{equation}
	\gamma_n(z) = \frac{w_n(z)}{w_n(0)},
\end{equation}
thus the laser intensity at detection is reduced by a factor $\gamma_n(z)^{-2}$.

At large distances,
\begin{equation}
	\gamma_n \approx \frac{z\tan(w_n(0)/(f_\mathrm{p}\cos\theta)}{w_n(0))}
\end{equation}
Taking the Taylor expansion of the tangent, one sees that the magnification factor is only weakly dependent on the harmonic source size ($f_\mathrm{p}$ is independent of the source size), whereas the magnification is strongly dependent on the the laser spot size ($\sim w_\mathrm{L}^4$).

At the new \ac{RPM} focal point, $z = z_\mathrm{f}$, the demagnification factor is \cite{vincentiOpticalPropertiesRelativistic2014}
\begin{equation}
	\gamma_n(z_\mathrm{f}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\Psi_n^2}},
\end{equation}
this determines the new peak intensity accessible via hole boring.

\section{\label{ch:3-sec:simulations}Simulations}
\subsection{1D PIC simulations of HHG}
Numerical simulations of the SP1 and SP2 interactions with CVD and PMMA were performed using the Smilei PIC code to confirm the results of the previous section for ORION beamline parameters. Application of the Bourdier method (plasma initialised streaming at $\mathbf{v}= c\sin\theta \mathbf{\hat{y}}$) enabled the accurate and computationally efficient reconstruction of the interactions in 1D, a necessity for the sub-ps ORION laser pulse duration. Despite the 1D geometry and optimised supercomputer architecture, resolution numerical heating and noise remained a serious issue. Edwards and Mikhailova noted for their single laser pulse cycle simulations that the highest resolved harmonic required 10 cells per wavelength and up to 5000 particles per cell was necessary for their noise requirements \cite{edwardsXRayEmissionEffectiveness2020} while numerical heating scales linearly with time. The fourth interpolation order for the particle shape function was found to be an efficient choice for the minimisation of numerical heating.

Fortunately, to make comparisons to the derivations of Section \ref{ch:3-sec:theory} only a low resolution is necessary. Simulation parameters are detailed in Table \ref{tab:orion-parameters}.

	\label{fig:orionsimfigs}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:orionsimfigs}a illustrates how the ion density profile evolves via hole boring. While the density increases to several times its initial level near the plasma surface, this need not be accounted for in the hole boring calculation since these additional ions have already acquired the necessary momentum and are simply propagating inwards with the surface. Figure \ref{fig:orionsimfigs}b clearly shows the harmonic content of the specularly reflected beam with harmonics retaining the spectral shape of the incident beam. Even harmonics are significantly supressed relative to odd harmonics. The bump in the distribution around the 18\th\ harmonic is an entirely numerical effect, increasing the simulation resolution shifts the bump to the right. These simulations had a resolution of 128 cells per laser wavelength, following Edwards and Mikhailova one can only trust this distribution up to the 12\th\ harmonic, at which point the distribution begins to change its shape. Clearly energy conservation does not hold for this simulation, however it is still possible to extract $I_0$ if we make the reasonable assumption that Debye heating does not affect the HHG process and that the spectrum is simply the sum of the two contributions (justified by the observation of the continuation of harmonics over the bump in the distribution). Thus, $I_0$ can simply be extracted as the the peak intensity of the distribution corresponding to the intensity at $\omega/\omega_\mathrm{L} = 1$).

Figure \ref{fig:orioncombinedi0ds} compares the analytically calculated parameters with those extracted from the simulations demonstrating excellent agreement for the parameter space accessible with the ORION laser facility and for the assumptions made in the analysis.

%Note that hole boring theory relies on the assumption of a quasi-static equilibrium. This is only true for a circularly polarised incident pulse.

	\label{fig:orioncompareiondentingtotheory}
\end{figure}
The deviation from the theoretical prediction increases with time. Numerical heating leads to higher electron temperatures at the plasma surface and correspondingly a spurious preplasma expansion analogous to the prepulse preplasma expansion. This is why artificially increasing the plasma temperature to increase the Debye length and reduce numerical heating, while improving HHG accuracy, reduces hole boring accuracy since on sub-ps timescales, there is the potential for significant preplasma expansion.

The X-ray harmonic spectrum produced from a CVD target irradiated by an SP1 type laser pulse is resolved in Figure \ref{fig:orionxrayharmonics}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figures/orion/orion_xray_harmonics}

	\label{fig:orionxrayharmonics}
\end{figure}
The simulation has 16384 cells per laser wavelength, the minimum multiple of 2 required to resolve the harmonics accessed with the OHREX quartz crystals. It was necessary to use a short test laser pulse with a $5\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ FWHM. The simulation time before the peak of laser pulse was increased to reduce the error in the spectrum from unphysical hard cutoffs to the laser pulse profile. A steep preplasma scale length was applied to the plasma distribution of $0.04\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ to model the peak of the ORION pulse and suppress \ac{CWE}. At the X-ray intensities of Figure \ref{fig:orionxrayharmonics}b, no harmonic structure is visible, indeed for the non-optimal ORION target chamber geometry, harmonics begin to merge from around the 20\th . Note the s-polarised part of the reflected beam is over 50 times weaker than the p-polarised beam at the 1000\th\ harmonic.
It would be interesting to extract the reflected beam temporal profile after filtering of sub X-ray harmonics. This can be achieved by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the Fourier transformed temporal profile with the lower order harmonics removed. Unfortunately, beyond $n=50$, the contribution in the signal from noise prevented the structure from being observed. Figure \ref{fig:orionattosecondpulse} compares the reflected pulse structure to the reflected pulse structure with harmonics below $n = 50$ removed. 
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
The filtered beam consists of a series of attosecond pulses of radiation, the brightest pulse is of duration 30.3 as. Note that the intensity of the first few laser cycles is insufficient for the generation of harmonics above $n = 50$ and there is therefore no signal here, reducing the pulse train length.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic simulations of preplasma formation}
Following Dollar \textit{et al} \cite{dollarScalingHighorderHarmonic2013}, hydrodynamic simulations of the ORION laser systems were performed using HYADES to confirm the suitability of the contrast conditions.

To do: calculate intensity on target and PM. Discuss how there is potentially a range of laser intensities thus had `high' intensity and `low' intensity sims (state what these mean for the two beamlines.)
All simulations were performed with s- and p-polarisation.

Parameters:
1D planar geometry
Mesh of 511 evenly space points covering \qty{20}{\mu m} of the target (SiO2, PMMA, CVD, etc)
Equation of state data taken from the in built HYADES data tables. For low temperatures and pressures, the data for the minimum value in the tables is used, for temperatures and pressures above the highest value in the tables, the values are linearly extrapolated from the edge.
The local thermal equilibrium average atom model is used for ionisation. 
At low temperatures ($T < 0.15 eV$) the absoprtion and refractive indices are input.
The threshold for laser energy absorption is set to \qty{1e6}{ergs.cm^{-2}} = \qty{0.1}{W.cm^{-2}}.
Electrons and ions are initialised at a temperature \qty{1.551e-2}{eV}.




Results:
No pre-ionisation or preplasma formation was observed in the simulations of the high contrast SP1 laser pulse with any target materials. This is in stark contrast with the SP2 laser, in the absence of a PM, the preplasma expansion of the targets is huge. Necessitating the use of a PM and further HYADES simulations.
First, the interaction between the SP2 and SiO$_2$ plasma mirror was simulated. Note that it is not possible to model the AR coating in hydrodynamic codes, instead it was assumed that the thin coating has minimal impact on the interaction. No ionisation was observed from the high intensity laser prepulse starting from 10 ns out from the main pulse. Figure \ref{fig:orionpmirradiation} plots the interaction between a low intensity main pulse and the plasma mirror.

	\label{fig:orionpmirradiation}
\end{figure}
% TODO add comment about at this point jsut getting to that ionisation threshold?
Similar results were obtained for s- and p-polarisation. These simulations suggest ionisation begins at the start of the main pulse with some preplasma expansion but more significantly is the hole boring. Note that hole boring on the PM need not be accounted for since the spot size is significantly larger and therefore this change in surface curvature has minimal effect. The collisionless skin depth and plasma frequency can be calculated at each point in the plasma  via the electron densoty and the corresponding laser attenuation at each point as in Figure \ref{fig:orionpmreflection} at the peak of the main pulse.
\begin{figure}
	\centering

	\label{fig:orionpmreflection}
\end{figure}
The laser is rapidly attenuated and therefore `switched-on' despite not attaining total ionisation at the front surface (reducing its reflectivity).

Satisfied that the PM operates as anticipated, a parameter scan of the targets was then conducted. Figure \ref{fig:oriontargetpreplasma}a describes the typical evolution of target density with the application of the SP2 prepulse, in this case after that prepulse has been attenuated by a plasma mirror with a reflectivity of 0.004.

By the time of the main pulse, hole boring is dominant over plasma expansion. b) An exponetial fit ($\rho \sim e^{x/L}$) for the preplasma scale length, $L$, at the time of arrival of the main pulse. For this simulation the optimum fit is $L = 0.12 \lambda_\mathrm{L}$.}
	\label{fig:oriontargetpreplasma}
\end{figure}
By the time of the main pulse arrival in this simulation, hole boring has overtaken preplasma expansion. Figure \ref{fig:oriontargetpreplasma}b demonstrates the exponential fit to obtain the corresponding close to optimal preplasma scale length of $L = 0.12 \lambda_\mathrm{L}$ at the time of arrival of the SP2 main pulse.

Figure \ref{fig:orionscalelengthparameterscan} repeats the analysis of \ref{fig:oriontargetpreplasma} for a variety of target materials, reflectivities, polarisations and laser intensities.

	\centering
	\includegraphics{figures/orion/orion_scale_length_parameter_scan}

The dashed line highlights the reflectivity of the SiO$_2$ AR coated PM for the SP2 wavelength. Preplasma scale length remains small for the range of parameters explored.}
	\label{fig:orionscalelengthparameterscan}
\end{figure}
The s-polarised light simulations follow a clear trend: increasing incident laser energy leads to an increased scale length up to a transition point that will be determined by the point at which hole boring overcomes plasma expansion. This will depend on the interplay of target ion density, ionisation potential and heating. Interestingly, the trend is much less consistent for p-polarised light. It is known that heating increases for p-polarised light as there is now a component of the laser pulse electric field acting into the plasma, however, the crossing of the high and low intensities suggests a dynamic balance between hole boring and plasma heating. Regardless, the change in scale length is not significant at these PM reflectivities. Unfortunately, it was not possible to conduct a similar parameter scan for the CVD targets, it would appear that the EOS tables for such a target material are not suited for this interaction type, the two tables offered provided inconsistent and unphysical results with specific simulations crashing at random. However, one can assume that the preplasma scale lengths of irradiated CVD targets would be lower than those established in Figure \ref{fig:orionscalelengthparameterscan} due to the high damage threshold of the material. 

% TODO state somewhere that we can expect hole boring to establish itself at the time where the laser becomes relativistic since at this point electrons at the surface can be compressed and ions can follow.
%TODO ensure methodology clear

It is interesting to return to the question of temperature raised with regards to the initialisation of PIC code main pulse simulations as presented in Chapter \ref{ch:zvp}. Figure \ref{fig:oriontemperature} plots the plasma electron temperature from 40 ps before the main pulse arrives.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics{figures/orion/orion_temperature}
	\caption[Typical electron temperature of a plastic target after irradiation by a petawatt class laser prepulse.]{\textbf{The typical electron temperature of a plastic target after irradiation by a petawatt class laser prepulse.} This is the same simulation as presented in Figure \ref{fig:oriontargetpreplasma}. Namely, an $a_0 = 30$ p-polarised laser pulse attenuated by a plasma mirror of reflectivity 0.004 incident on an HDPE target at \qty{16}{\degree}. The bulk and preplasma temperatures differ by multiple orders of magnitude.}
	\label{fig:oriontemperature}
\end{figure}
Once plasma expansion initiates the extent of heating rapidly diverges across the preplasma and bulk. Arguably it does not make sense to define a temperature for a system clearly not in equilibrium. Indeed, there is no standard practice and yet it can have significant effect such as has been seen in simulations on hole boring and \textbf{ paper on prepulses and cooler being better}. Clearly, plasma temperature will be highly sensitive to the precise experimental conditions. At the time of the main pulse arrival at plasma surface (as defined by the peak of the electron density distribution), the temperature is 112 eV, consistent with the value chosen for PIC simulations. Note that hydrodynamic codes would be unsuitable for the prediction of the plasma temperature increase from the main pulse interaction given the highly non-linear dynamics in this regime could not be accurately captured by such a code.

\section{\label{ch:3-sec:data_processing}Experimental data processing}

\subsection{Image plate calibration}
Image plates (IPs) are reusable recording media that detect ionising radiation and are particularly suitable for the detection of X-rays produced in laser-plasma interactions. Their response is well understood and their sensitivities to a wide spectrum photon energies have been absolutely calibrated on the ORION facility \cite{meadowcroftEvaluationSensitivityFading2008}. Albeit for the FLA3000 scanner not the FLA7000 used in this experiment. However, the deviation in response is negligible for the photon energies measured. In this experiment the Fuji Biological Analysis System (BAS) TR-type IPs were used. They have a phosphor layer composed of $\mathrm{BaFBr_{0.085}I_{0.15}}$ with density \qty{2.61}{g.cm^{-3}} and thickness \qty{60}{\mu m} but no mylar layer. This makes them suitable for low energy X-ray detection. When scanned, the IP releases blue photons via photostimuated luminescence (PSL), which is then collected by a photomultiplier tube. The PSL value is generalised across scanner types from the measured `Grey' ($G$) value by
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{PSL} = (0.23284G^2\times 10^{-9})\left(\frac{\Delta x}{100}\right)^2W\times 10^{-L/2},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta x$ is the scanner resolution (= \qty{25}{\mu m} in this experiment), $L$ is the latitude parameter, and
\begin{equation}
	W = 0.092906 + 1370.8e^{-0.014874V} +  654.24e^{-0.011026},
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the scanner voltage \cite{golovinCalibrationImagingPlates2021}.

IP photon sensitivity, $\psi$, the number of PSLs per incident photon, is dependent on photon energy. Meadowcroft \textit{et al} modelled this as,
\begin{equation}
	\psi_j = \eta(m_jh\nu + c_j),
\end{equation}
where $h\nu$ is the photon energy and $m_j$ and $c_j$ are linear fit parameters valid for specific energy ranges, $j$. For the Fuji BAS TR-type IP and for X-rays in the range 0-6.0 keV, $m_j = \qty{0.54\pm0.05}{mPSL.keV^{-1}}$ and $c_j = \qty{0.02\pm0.002}{mPSL}$. The IP absorption efficiency in mPSL per photon is
\begin{equation}
	\eta(h\nu,T_i,T_s) = \exp{(-n_\mathrm{i}\Phi_\mathrm{i} (h\nu)T_\mathrm{i})}[1-\exp{(-n_\mathrm{s}\Phi_\mathrm{s}(h\nu)T_\mathrm{s})}],
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the layer density, $\Phi(h\nu)$ is the total cross-section of the layer, $T$ the effective layer thickness, s and i correspond to the sensitive (phosphor) and insensitive (mylar) layers of the IP respectively \cite{izumiApplicationImagingPlates2006}. The first term is neglected in the absence of an insensitive (mylar) layer in TR-type IP. Below 50 keV, the dominant mode for X-ray absorption into the IP is the photo-electric effect, where
\begin{equation}
	\Phi_\mathrm{ph} \approx \num{3e12}\frac{Z^4}{(h\nu)^{3.5}}   
\end{equation}
and $Z$ is the atomic number \cite{fornalskiSimpleEmpiricalCorrection2018} and $\Phi_\mathrm{ph}$ is given in units of Barn per atom. At 2.4 keV, that corresponds to a sensitivity of 1.32 mPSL per incident photon.

It is generally inevitable that some time will elapse between laser shot and IP scan. For this experiment 30 minutes was typical, in which time some fading of the IP occurs that must be accounted for. IP fading can be modelled as an attenuation factor,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:orion.Ft}
	F(t) = A\exp{(-t/\tau)} + B,
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time between shot and scan and $A$, $\tau$ and $B$ are found from fits to experimental data. A key aspect of the exponential decay is that the attenuation depends only on the signal at that moment in time and not the initial conditions. This has been shown to be true in experiment \cite{meadowcroftEvaluationSensitivityFading2008}.

At \qty{20}{\degree C} at the ORION facility \textit{Meadowcroft et al} \cite{meadowcroftEvaluationSensitivityFading2008} determined that for the Fuji BAS TR-type IP, the optimum fit for the parameters of Equation \ref{eq:orion.Ft} is $A = \num{0.347\pm0.022}$, $B = \num{0.693\pm0.011}$ and $\tau = \qty{35.5\pm5.3}{minutes}$. Therefore at 30 minutes, $F(t) = 0.84$.

In summary, the number of PSL measured on an IP can be converted to an incident number of photons via
\begin{equation}
	N(h\nu) = \frac{\mathrm{PSL}}{F(t)}\frac{10^3}{\psi(h\nu)} = P(h\nu) \mathrm{PSL}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{OHREX calibration}
% TODO Reword note on illuminating crystal once I have written up about hole boring.
The Orion High REsolution X-ray spectrometer (OHREX), housed on the ORION laser target chamber outer wall, utilises a spherically bent crystal geometry to spatially focus and spectrally analyse photons from the target chamber \cite{beiersdorferLineshapeSpectroscopyVery2016} with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The measured signal has been absolutely calibrated for a range of energies using a variety of crystals \cite{macdonaldAbsoluteThroughputCalibration2021}. The OHREX can hold two crystals at a time. At each crystal's spatial focal plane a two-dimensional image is formed, one dimension is spatial, the other spectral. The energy range accessed by a given crystal is determined by the crystal rotation but all OHREX crystals are designed for operation at a nominal central Bragg angle of $\theta_\mathrm{B} = 51.3$\degree with the corresponding wavelength determined from Bragg's Law, $n\lambda = 2d\sin\theta_\mathrm{B}$, for the appropriate crystal plane. The range around that central photon energy is determined by the crystal width in the spectral dimension.

MacDonald \textit{et al} determined a quadratic fit for each crystal's dispersion relation to connect position along the image to photon energy \cite{macdonaldAbsoluteThroughputCalibration2021}. Unfortunately in this experiment, the image lengths varied from those in the previous experiment, a likely consequence of slight defocusing of the optic. Note that the OHREX geometry is designed such that precise focus is not necessary to achieve good results \cite{beiersdorferLineshapeSpectroscopyVery2016}.

Instead, a simple linear dispersion relation based on the known maximum and minimum energies accessed by the crystal was applied across the crystal images, a reasonable approximation to the dispersion relation determined by MacDonald \textit{et al} \cite{macdonaldAbsoluteThroughputCalibration2021} (the quadratic correction is small). The energy ranges for the three lowest energy OHREX crystals are given in table \ref{tab:dispersion}.

Provided full illumination of the \qty{6}{cm} $\times$ \qty{4}{cm} crystal, the spatial dimension can be safely integrated over to calculate the measured signal, $M(h\nu)$ in \unit{J.mm^{-1}} and remove uncertainty from the IP drifting from the ideal focal plane. (In this experiment we assume that the harmonic beam width at the crystal position is larger than the size of the crystal, a reasonable assumption since beam divergence $\approx$ \qty{10}{\degree} and the \qty{6}{cm} x \qty{4}{cm} crystal sits \qty{2.4}{m} from the target.). This corresponds to a source spetral intensity incident on the crystal $S(h\nu)$ measured in \unit{J.keV^{-1}.sr^{-1}} via the spectrometer response, $G(h\nu)$, explicitly,
\begin{equation}
	M(h\nu) = S(h\nu)G(h\nu).
\end{equation}
The absolute throughput of the crystals was measured by MacDonald \textit{et al} in a previous ORION experiment and fit parameters for 
\begin{equation}
	G(h\nu) = A(h\nu)^2 + B(h\nu) + C,
\end{equation}
where $(h\nu)$ is the photon energy measured in eV, determined for both p- and s-polarised incident light and for first and second diffraction orders \cite{macdonaldAbsoluteThroughputCalibration2021}. The parameters for the lowest few energy crystals are presents in Table \ref{tab:orion_OHREX}.

Note that no data is available for the first order of the quartz ($10\bar{1}0$) crystal.}
\label{tab:orion_OHREX}
\end{table}
There is unfortunately no spectrometer response data for the $10\bar{1}0$ crystal to first order due to the Si K edge sitting within the energy range and the dramatic effect this has on absorption in its vicinity \cite{hellCalibrationOHREXHighresolution2016}.


The OHREX is equipped with a \qty{50}{\mu m} Beryllium filter to protect the crystals. The corresponding signal attenuation can be calculated using X-ray transmission data \cite{henkeXRayInteractionsPhotoabsorption1993a}.

\subsection{Extracting the data}
The quartz OHREX crystals $10\bar{1}0$ and $10\bar{1}1$ were fielded on the experiment. Crystal images were recorded with BasTR2040 Fuji Image Plate. A typical shot image scanned with the FLA7000 scanner and converted to photostimulated luminescence units (PSLs) is given in Figure \ref{fig:orionohrexshot28psl}.
%todo point out both crystal images and label them
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/orion/orion_OHREX_shot28_psl}
	\caption[Unprocessed IP from ORION experiment]{Unprocessed shot data from a FLA7000 scanned image plate converted to PSLs. The image plate and two crystal images are clearly visible.}
	\label{fig:orionohrexshot28psl}
\end{figure}
The average background signal was subtracted. The $x$- and $y$-axes were converted from pixels to to mm using the scanner resolution, (\qty{25}{\mu m.px^{-1}}) and then energies using the appropriate dispersion relations. The data was then integrated over $y$ to obtain the intensity in units of \unit{PSL.mm^{-1}} across each crystal image. Then the corresponding source signal is
\begin{equation}
	S(h\nu)[\unit{J.keV^{-1}.sr^{-1}}] = \frac{d\mathrm{PSL}}{dx}\frac{P(h\nu)}{G(h\nu)}h\nu,
\end{equation}
which can then be converted to a measured spectral intensity per harmonic at distance $r=1$ from the source, ready to be directly compared to the theory,
\begin{equation}
	I^\mathrm{meas}_\mathrm{n}|_{(r = \qty{1}{m})} = S(h\nu)\frac{dh\nu(keV)}{dn}.
\end{equation}

No sensitivity data is available for the $10\bar{1}0$ quartz crystal, instead this lower energy crystal was fielded to attempt resolving of the X-ray harmonics. At the experiment planning stage it was unknown if this would be possible. Now that the simulations have been performed, we know that the non-optimal ORION target chamber geometry leads to merging of the harmonics even before the water window at 282 eV. This is consistent with the findings, Figure \ref{fig:orionq1010} is a typical integrated signal in \unit{PSL.mm} and the corresponding Fourier transform for the quartz ($10\bar{1}0$) crystal image.

\subsubsection{Calibration and polarisation}
% TODO reference simulation figure that shows only p pol light reflected.
% TODO write up the OHREX polarisation stuff
% TODO put efficiency of only p pol reflected into the theory prediction, I think at this moment I am coming at it from the experiment side which is wrong.
% TODO add in polarisations of SP1 and SP2 for the OHREX angles out of the plane.
The choice of the spectrometer response function, $G(h\nu)$, is non-trivial. One must firstly be assured that the second order contribution is small relative to the first, true for this source spectrum. And also think carefully about the anticipated polarisation in the OHREX interaction plane. The OHREX response to p-polarised light is approximately an order of magnitude lower than for s-polarised light. From Figure X we are assured that only the p-polarised (with respect to the target interaction plane) X-rays are specularly reflected to the OHREX. Corresponding polarisation out of the OHREX interaction plane is calculated in the Appendix. The polarisation of the HHG beam relative to the OHREX plane of incidence and reflection is \qty{10.5}{\degree} out of the plane. Unlike for the RPM interaction, the OHREX crystal reflection is an entirely linear process and it is therefore acceptable to decompose the laser pulse into its constituents, explicitly, the field incident on the crystal is
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{E_\mathrm{O}} = \mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, s} + \mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, p}.
\end{equation}
After interaction with the crystal the field is
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{detector} = \alpha_\mathrm{s}(h\nu)\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, s} + \alpha_\mathrm{p}(h\nu)\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, p},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i(h\nu)$ is the energy dependent $(h\nu)$ amplitude sensitivity of the reflection for s- and p-polarised respectively. Since the two polarisations are orthogonal, the intensity is
\begin{equation}
	I = \alpha^2_\mathrm{s}(h\nu)|\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, s}|^2 + \alpha^2_\mathrm{p}(h\nu)|\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, p}|^2.
\end{equation}
Noting that $\alpha^2_i(h\nu)$ are the calibration factors, $G_i(h\nu)$, and that
\begin{equation}
	|\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, s}| = |\mathbf{E_\mathrm{O}}|\sin\phi
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	|\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{O,\, p}| = |\mathbf{E_\mathrm{O}}|\cos\phi,
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is the angle out of the interaction plane,
\begin{equation}
	I_\mathrm{detector} = (G_\mathrm{s}(h\nu)\sin^2\phi + G_\mathrm{p}(h\nu)\cos^2\phi)|\mathbf{E_\mathrm{O}}|^2 = F(h\nu)|\mathbf{E_\mathrm{O}}|^2,
\end{equation}
where $F(h\nu) =  (G_\mathrm{s}(h\nu)\sin^2\phi + G_\mathrm{p}(h\nu)\cos^2\phi$ is the energy dependent calibration factor for this OHREX orientation.

\section{Experimental results}

Figure \ref{fig:orionq1011} is a typical calibrated signal from the quartz ($10\bar{1}1$) crystal, ready for comparison to the theoretical prediction.
\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:orionq1011}
\end{figure}
For each shot the mean signal across the dispersion axis was calculated and the errors from statistics, the fade time (11 \%), the IP sensitivity (1.5 \%), the dispersion axis (2.9 \%) and the OHREX crystal reflectivity (11 \%) accounted for.
% TODO Shots were also taken through the OHREX port, we had hoped to capture the beam divergence however, the beam was larger than initially expected and we were unable to distinguish much. Mention saturation.

As demonstrated in Section \ref{ch:3-sec:theory}, the intensity of X-ray harmonics is highly sensitive to the intensity of individual pulse cycles due to the proximity of the measurement to the exponential roll off in the spectrum. However, even neglecting the shot-to-shot variation, it is not possible to know the precise sub-cycle spatio-temporal struture of a petawatt-class laser pulse. Indeed, the simple measurement of the peak intensity of such a pulse remains an open problem \cite{perevalovLaserPeelerRegime2023,ouatuIonizationStatesMultipetawatt2022}. Instead we must rely on our assumptions and approximations, that is that the SP1 and SP2 beamlines can be adequately described by spatial Gaussians and temporal sech$^2$ and sech profiles respectively, and that the duration and energy are well defined. The tight focused laser spot is subject to jitter on a shot-to-shot basis. This was routinely monitored via a KBRXM diagnostic that measures X-ray emission from the target. The spot measured by this diagnostic will always be larger than the actual laser pulse focal spot due to the energy transport of electrons moving away from the interaction area. This upper limit on laser pulse spot size corresponds to a lower limit on laser pulse intensity and therefore also of HHG efficiency. Figure \ref{fig:orionintensitycurves} plots HHG spectral intensity curves for the quartz ($10\bar{1}1$) crystal central energy as a function of laser spot size for the targets and laser pulse configurations explored in the experiment. 
\begin{figure}

	\caption[Dependence of the harmonic beam spectral intensity on laser spot size at 2.405 keV.]{\textbf{Dependence of the harmonic beam spectral intensity on laser spot size at 2.405 keV.} Targets and beamlines relevant to the experiment are plotted. The half energy single beamlet SP1 laser is demarcated by $E/2$. The thick lines indicate likely values for the laser spot sizes in this experiment. The SP1 harmonic beams are strongly affected by the exponential roll off unlike the SP2 beamline.}
	\label{fig:orionintensitycurves}
\end{figure}
The thick lines range from the uppper limits of spot size as measured by the KBRXM diagnostic to the spot area being halved. The spectral intensity of the harmonic beam from the SP1 beamline sits in a delicate balance between beam divergence via hole boring and the exponential roll off. Note that only the roll off leads to a reduction in the total energy contained within the harmonic beam. The strong non-linearity of the interaction leads to the single beamlet SP1 beamline producing a harmonic beam over 6 times weaker than the double beamlet configuration. Interestingly, the higher intensity of the SP2 beamline leads to a greater divergence and a lower spectral intensity of the harmonic beam than for the SP1 laser pulse.

Figure \ref{fig:orionexperimentresults} plots the experimental results with comparison to theory and simulation. 
\begin{figure}

	\label{fig:orionexperimentresults}
\end{figure}
Experimental data points are consistent within their errors with one another, the theory and the simulation, albeit with large uncertainties with such a low shot number. It is highly significant that the SP2 beamline is on average almost 6 times brighter than the SP1 beamline despite the greater energy content and greater component of the laser pulse electric field directed into the plasma for the SP2 beamline while the single beamlet shot is over 7 times weaker in intensity compared to the mean intensity of the full SP2 beamline. These highly non-linear (with respect to energy) scalings are consistent with HHG theory but cannot be understood as originating from bremmstrahlung lending huge credibility to these results. Bremsstrahlung emission scales sub-linearly with temperature and temperature scales sub-linearly with energy on target. The total energy is well-constrained and this is far more relevant for Bremsstrahlung than the uncertain intensity (dependent on the variable spot size). Thus, at best case scenario one could anticipate twice the intensity being observed for the double beamlet SP2 compared to the single.





Bremsstrahlung emission from steep density profile low-Z solid density targets irradiated by relativistic laser pulses remains an area of active research with experiments to explore this in the planning stages at the University of York. However, provided a few assumptions it is possible to derive approximate best case scenario scalings of spectral intensity with incident energy. First, assume that energy absorption into the plasma target does not increase with increasing energy. From Equation
% TODO add derivation of plasma temperature from start of Chen to intro then reference here
the plasma temperature scales linearly with the incident energy. Now, assuming the target can be treated as a radiating black body, Equation 
% TODO add note on black body and and reference spectral radiance here
increases most rapidly with temperature when $h\nu \ll k_\mathrm{B}T$ at which point the spectral radiance scales linearly with temperature. Thus, at best case we could expect a linear increase in the spectral intensity measured from the double beamlet compared to the single if that signal originated from Bremsstrahlung emission. Note further that this scaling depends not on the incident intensity but only on the incident energy which is a well-constrained quantity on ORION, \textit{i.e.} we do not anticipate significant shot-to-shot variation.

The above discussion relied on the assumptions of equilibrium and a black-body radiation spectrum.
While this is valid for the long radiating period after the interaction, in much of this thesis, emphasis has been placed on the non-equilibrium state of the interaction itself. There are two species of relevance during this time: the hot electrons around the front surface directly heated by the laser pulse and prepulse, and the hot electrons that are reflected specularly and are responsible for the HHG. In \cite{zulickHighResolutionBremsstrahlung2013}, bremsstrahlung of these species are measured experimentally for a 30 fs laser pulse and $a_0$ = 2.8. As the populations of each of these species are so small, the peak contribution to the photon spectrum is many orders of magnitude smaller than that of the experimental signal and can therefore be neglected.
% TODO check in the above that they used a circualrly pol pulse so that HHG would be supperssed?

These findings are highly significant. 
Then write up the new peak intensity and the efficiencies.
