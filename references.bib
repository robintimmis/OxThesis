The optimal parameters were obtained from a self-consistent system of Maxwell equations and the equation of motion of electron layer. For thin relativistic electron layers, the gaining of maximum electron energies requires a second additional overdense plasma layer, thus cutting the laser radiation off the plasma screen at the instant of gaining the maximum energy (DREAM-schema).},

Streams of bunches can be used to simultaneously and independently generate pulsed X-ray radiation as fast electrons hit secondary targets. Dependences of bunch parameters (the number of particles in the bunch and the bunch energy and thickness) on the angle of incidence and laser intensity have been obtained. It has been shown that, upon reflection from the target, the relativistic-intensity laser wave is efficiently converted (the energy-conversion factor reaches {$\sim$}20\%) into a sequence of electromagnetic tens-of-nanometer-long atto pulses, which follow one after another in the period of the initial laser wave. We have investigated how the parameters of the atto pulse depend on the angle of incidence and the laser intensity. We have shown that atto pulses are generated most efficiently at large angles of incidence ({$\geq$}50) of the laser pulse on the target. \textcopyright{} 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

We go on to show analytically that the time-step must be significantly less than {$\lambda$}/ca0 to achieve good accuracy. We thus propose adaptive electron sub-cycling as an efficient remedy.},

On the basis of the ultrarelativistic similarity theory we show that the high-order harmonic spectrum is universal, i.e., it does not depend on the interaction details. The spectrum includes the power-law part In \^a n\^a 8\^a \textbullet 3 for n{$<$} 8\^I{$\pm$} \^I max3, followed by exponential decay. Here \^I max is the largest relativistic \^I factor of the plasma surface and \^I{$\pm$} is the second derivative of the surface velocity at this moment. The high-order harmonic cutoff at \^a \^I max3 is parametrically larger than the 4 \^I max2 predicted by the simple \^a\texteuro\oe oscillating mirror\^a\texteuro{} model based on the Doppler effect. The cornerstone of our theory is the new physical phenomenon: spikes in the relativistic \^I factor of the plasma surface. These spikes define the high-order harmonic spectrum and lead to attosecond pulses in the reflected radiation. \textcopyright{} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

The ZVP-mechanism is a nonponderomotive absorption mechanism that should dominate in the interaction of very strong short laser pulses (a0{$\gg$}1) with overdense plasmas in the case of sharp density gradients. In the ZVP-mechanism the existence of moving zeroes in the vector potential of the relativistic skin layer is crucial to the generation of both fast electron bunches and coherent x-rays. We demonstrate that the laser energy is absorbed from the plasma on the attosecond timescale in the form of electron bunches with unprecedentedly short duration. The numerical simulations are able to validate all qualitative and quantitative aspects of the ZVP-mechanism. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {We have developed a high-resolution x-ray spectrometer for measuring the shapes of spectral lines produced from laser-irradiated targets on the Orion laser facility. The instrument utilizes a spherically bent crystal geometry to spatially focus and spectrally analyze photons from foil or microdot targets. The high photon collection efficiency resulting from its imaging properties allows the instrument to be mounted outside the Orion chamber, where it is far less sensitive to particles, hard x-rays, or electromagnetic pulses than instruments housed close to the target chamber center in ten-inch manipulators. Moreover, Bragg angles above 50\textdegree{} are possible, which provide greatly improved spectral resolution compared to radially viewing, near grazing-incidence crystal spectrometers. These properties make the new instrument an ideal lineshape diagnostic for determining plasma temperature and density. We describe its calibration on the Livermore electron beam ion trap facility and present spectral data of the K-shell emission from highly charged sulfur produced by long-pulse as well as short-pulse beams on the Orion laser in the United Kingdom.},

This paper emphasizes the development of PIC computer experiments since the 1950's starting with one-dimensional (1-D) chargedsheet models, the addition of the mesh, and fast direct Poisson equation solvers for 2-D and 3-D.The finite-size particle-in-mesh (finite AZ, At) theory of Langdon [51]-[53] is presented in part to display the effects of too small Ao/Ax, even for Maxwellianvelocity distributions,as a caution, for example, when some ions are cooled to background gas temperatures by charge exchange. Early work on adding collisions to 1-D chargesheet models by Burger [28] and Shanny et aL[76] are presented, with many of the elements of current Monte Carlo codes. Bounded plasma modeling is presented with electrode charges and external R, L, C,and V(t), Z(t) sources now in use on fast desktop computers as real-time computer experiments, complementinganalytic modeling and laboratory experiments. The addition of Monte Carlo collisions (usually done with irregular timesteps) to PIC (usually done with uniform At's) is displayed as a developing art, relying on experimental total cross sections and approximate analytical differential cross sections to produce changes in charged-particlespeed and direction due to collisions with neutrals, so far including elastic, excitation, ionization, charge exchange, and attachment processes.},

Using the Lee-More resistivity model and the Thomas-Fermi ionisation model very little difference in the level of filamentation is found.

  abstract = {The interest in relativistic beam-plasma instabilities has been greatly rejuvenated over the past two decades by novel concepts in laboratory and space plasmas. Recent advances in this long-standing field are here reviewed from both theoretical and numerical points of view. The primary focus is on the two-dimensional spectrum of unstable electromagnetic waves growing within relativistic, unmagnetized, and uniform electron beam-plasma systems. Although the goal is to provide a unified picture of all instability classes at play, emphasis is put on the potentially dominant waves propagating obliquely to the beam direction, which have received little attention over the years. First, the basic derivation of the general dielectric function of a kinetic relativistic plasma is recalled. Next, an overview of two-dimensional unstable spectra associated with various beam-plasma distribution functions is given. Both cold-fluid and kinetic linear theory results are reported, the latter being based on waterbag and Maxwell\textendash J\"uttner model distributions. The main properties of the competing modes (developing parallel, transverse, and oblique to the beam) are given, and their respective region of dominance in the system parameter space is explained. Later sections address particle-in-cell numerical simulations and the nonlinear evolution of multidimensional beam-plasma systems. The elementary structures generated by the various instability classes are first discussed in the case of reduced-geometry systems. Validation of linear theory is then illustrated in detail for large-scale systems, as is the multistaged character of the nonlinear phase. Finally, a collection of closely related beam-plasma problems involving additional physical effects is presented, and worthwhile directions of future research are outlined.},

This midscale prototype was designed to produce 0.5-PW pulses with technologies scalable to tens of petawatts. Technology choices made for MTW-OPAL were guided by the longer-term goal of two full-scale OPALs pumped by the OMEGA EP to produce 2 \texttimes{} 25-PW beams that would be co-located with kilojoule-nanosecond ultraviolet beams. Several MTWOPAL campaigns that have been completed since ``first light'' in March 2020 show that the laser design is fundamentally sound, and optimization continues as we prepare for ``first-focus'' campaigns later this year.},

The absorption and reflection of the ultraintense electromagnetic laser radiation from a sharp-boundary plasma, high harmonic generation, and the transformation into low-frequency radiation are discussed. In the case of weak plasma nonuniformity the excitation of nonlinear Langmuir oscillations in the plasma resonance region and the resulting electron acceleration are investigated. The vacuum heating of the electrons and the self-intersection of the electron trajectories are also studied. In the case of a sharp-boundary plasma, part of the energy of the laser pulse is found to be converted into a localized, relativistically strong, nonlinear electromagnetic pulse propagating into the plasma. The expansion of the hot electron cloud into the vacuum region and the action of the ponderomotive force of the laser pulse in the localized longitudinal electric field of the Langmuir oscillations lead to ion acceleration. The energy increase of a minority population of multicharged ions is found to be much greater than that of the ambient ions.},

Through irradiation of nanometric tungsten needles, we obtain multi-MeV energy electron bunches, whose energy and direction can be steered by the combined effect of the induced near-field and the laser field. We identified a two-step mechanism for the electron acceleration: (i) ejection within a sub-half-optical-cycle into the near-field from the target at {$>$}TVm-1 acceleration fields, and (ii) subsequent acceleration in vacuum by the intense laser field.

A promising\textemdash yet challenging\textemdash approach to achieve such extreme fields consists in reflecting a high-power femtosecond laser pulse off a curved relativistic mirror. This enhances the intensity of the reflected beam by simultaneously compressing it in time down to the attosecond range, and focusing it to submicrometre focal spots. Here we show that such curved relativistic mirrors can be produced when an ultra-intense laser pulse ionizes a solid target and creates a dense plasma that specularly reflects the incident light. This is evidenced by measuring the temporal and spatial effects induced on the reflected beam by this so-called plasma mirror. The all-optical measurement technique demonstrated here will be instrumental for the use of relativistic plasma mirrors with the upcoming generation of petawatt lasers that recently reached intensities of 5 \texttimes{} 1022 W cm-2, and therefore constitutes a viable experimental path to the Schwinger limit.},

This work presents the first comprehensive two-dimensional kinetic simulation of the cone-guided approach to fast ignition. Simulation results predict the hot electron temperature to be much lower than previously expected, which indicates the possibility of using them for optimum core heating. Furthermore, the roles of collisional versus kinetic processes for transport and heating mechanisms of the core plasmas are clarified. The core heating efficiency scales linearly with intensity at ranges of 1019\textendash 1020W/cm2, but falls below this range due to deflection of hot electrons in strong magnetic filaments behind the cone target.},

The potential of this source for medical imaging was demonstrated by performing micro-computed tomography of a human femoral trabecular bone sample, allowing full 3D reconstruction to a resolution below 50\,{$\mu$}m. The use of a 1\,cm long wakefield accelerator means that the length of the beamline (excluding the laser) is dominated by the x-ray imaging distances rather than the electron acceleration distances. The source possesses high peak brightness, which allows each image to be recorded with a single exposure and reduces the time required for a full tomographic scan. These properties make this an interesting laboratory source for many tomographic imaging applications.},

With the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Professors Donna Strickland and Gerard Mourou for the development of the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA), which made these lasers possible, we celebrate by providing a comprehensive update of the current status of ultra-high-power lasers and demonstrate how the technology has developed. We are now in the era of multi-petawatt facilities coming online, with 100 PW lasers being proposed and even under construction. In addition to this there is a pull towards development of industrial and multi-disciplinary applications, which demands much higher repetition rates, delivering high-average powers with higher efficiencies and the use of alternative wavelengths: mid-IR facilities. So apart from a comprehensive update of the current global status, we want to look at what technologies are to be deployed to get to these new regimes, and some of the critical issues facing their development.},

  abstract = {High harmonic generation by relativistically intense laser pulses from overdense plasma layers is surveyed. High harmonics are generated in form of (sub-)attosecond pulses when the plasma surface rebounds towards the observer with relativistic velocity. Different cases are considered. The "relativistically oscillating mirror" (ROM) model, describing the most typical case, is analyzed in detail. The resulting harmonic spectrum is usually a power law with the exponent -8/3 [baeva2006relativistic], but possible exceptions due to "higher order \textbackslash gamma-spikes" are considered. It is shown that under certain conditions, ultra-dense electron nanobunches can be formed at plasma surface that emit coherent synchrotron radiation. The resulting spectrum is much flatter and leads to the formation of a giant attosecond pulse in the reflected radiation. The harmonics radiation is also considered in time domain, where they form a train of attosecond pulses. It is characterized and a possibility to select a single attosecond pulse via polarization gating is described. Further, the line structure in relativistic harmonic spectra is analyzed. It is shown that the harmonics have an intrinsic chirp and it can be responsible for experimentally observed spectral modulations. Finally, high harmonic generation is considered in realistic three-dimensional geometry. It is shown that free space diffraction can act as a high pass filter, altering the spectrum and the reflected field structure. The high harmonics tend to be self-focused by the reflecting surface. This leads to a natural angular divergence as well as to field boost at the focal position. Coherently focusing the harmonics using an optimized geometry may result in a significantly higher field than the field of the driving laser.},

The reflected intensity and beam quality were found to be relatively constant with respect to intensity for bulk targets. For submicron targets, the measured reflectivity drops substantially without a corresponding increase in transmission, indicating increased conversion of fundamental to other wavelengths and particle heating. Experimental results and trends observed in 3D particle-in-cell simulations emphasize the critical role of ion motion due to radiation pressure on the absorption process. Ion motion during ultra-short pulses enhances the electron heating, which subsequently transfers more energy to the ions.},

High-order harmonic generation (HOHG) using short pulse ({$<$}100 fs) infrared lasers focused to intensities surpassing 1018 W cm -2 onto a solid density plasma is a promising means of generating such short pulses. Critical to the relativistic oscillating mirror mechanism is the steepness of the plasma density gradient at the reflection point, characterized by a scale length, which can strongly influence the harmonic generation mechanism. It is shown that for intensities in excess of 1021 W cm-2 an optimum density ramp scale length exists that balances an increase in efficiency with a growth of parametric plasma wave instabilities. We show that for these higher intensities the optimal scale length is c/{$\omega$}0, for which a variety of HOHG properties are optimized, including total conversion efficiency, HOHG divergence, and their power law scaling. Particle-in-cell simulations show striking evidence of the HOHG loss mechanism through parametric instabilities and relativistic self-phase modulation, which affect the produced spectra and conversion efficiency. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Relativistic laser plasmas have been shown to provide a robust platform for the generation of bright attosecond pulses via the relativistically oscillating mirror and coherent wake emission mechanisms. Theoretical work, however, has shown an alternative method for achieving this goal: dense nanobunch formation and acceleration on timescales of less than an optical laser cycle ({$\sim$}10 -15 s) during relativistic laser-plasma interactions. This opens up the exciting potential for developing a new bright ultrafast extreme ultraviolet XUV/x-ray source. Here we demonstrate, using a previously unexplored geometry, coherent synchrotron emission generated during relativistically intense laser-ultrathin foil interactions which extends to {$\sim$}1 keV photon energies. Particle-in-cell code simulations reveal how periodic sub-laser cycle acceleration of dense nanobunches of electrons formed during normal incidence interactions result in bursts of bright attosecond radiation in transmission and how these pulses relate to plasma density scalelength. This work shows clear potential for a novel, intense source of attosecond XUV ({$\sim$}10-18 s) radiation. Experimentally, high order (n) harmonic spectra (I(n)) are characterized by a slow decay (n-1.62 ) before a rapid efficiency rollover. Such a microscopic coherent synchrotron source ({$<$}5 \texttimes{} 10 -6 m) has the potential to significantly increase XUV pulse brightness significantly over current sources. \textcopyright{} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

This scenario is realized by the relativistically oscillating plasma surface generated by an ultraintense laser focused onto a solid target. Until now, it has been unclear whether the conditions necessary to exploit such phenomena can survive such an extreme interaction with increasing laser intensity. Here, we provide the first quantitative evidence to suggest that they can. We show that the occurrence of surface smoothing on the scale of the wavelength of the generated harmonics, and plasma denting of the irradiated surface, enables the production of high-quality X-ray beams focused down to the diffraction limit. These results improve the outlook for generating extreme X-ray fields, which could in principle extend to the Schwinger limit.},

Probing these dynamics with atomic-site specificity requires the extension of sub-femtosecond pulses to the soft X-ray spectral region. Here, we report the generation of isolated soft X-ray attosecond pulses with an X-ray free-electron laser. Our source has a pulse energy that is millions of times larger than any other source of isolated attosecond pulses in the soft X-ray spectral region, with a peak power exceeding 100 GW.

  abstract = {Relativistic high-order harmonic generation from solid-density plasma offers a compact source of coherent ultraviolet and x-ray light. For solid targets much thinner than the laser wavelength, the plasma thickness can be tuned to increase conversion efficiency; a reduction in total charge allows for balancing the laser and plasma driving forces, producing the most effective interaction. Unlike for semi-infinite plasma surfaces, we find that for ultrathin foil targets the dominant factor in the emission spectral shape is the finite width of the electron nanobunches, leading to a power-law exponent of approximately 10/3. Ultrathin foils produce higher-efficiency frequency conversion than solid targets for moderately relativistic (1},

  abstract = {Ultrashort pulsed lasers provide uniquely detailed access to the ultrafast dynamics of physical, chemical, and biological systems, but only a handful of wavelengths are directly produced by solid-state lasers, necessitating efficient high-power frequency conversion. Relativistic plasma mirrors generate broadband power-law spectra, that may span the gap between petawatt-class infrared laser facilities and x-ray free-electron lasers; despite substantial theoretical work the ultimate efficiency of this relativistic high-order-harmonic generation remains unclear. We show that the coherent radiation emitted by plasma mirrors follows a power-law distribution of energy over frequency with an exponent that, even in the ultrarelativistic limit, strongly depends on the ratio of laser intensity to plasma density and exceeds the frequently quoted value of -8/3 over a wide range of parameters. The coherent synchrotron emission model, when adequately corrected for the finite width of emitting electron bunches, is not just valid for p-polarized light and thin foil targets, but generally describes relativistic harmonic generation, including at normal incidence and with finite-gradient plasmas. Our numerical results support the {$\omega-$}4/3 scaling of the synchrotron emission model as a limiting efficiency of the process under most conditions. The highest frequencies that can be generated with this scaling are usually restricted by the width of the emitting electron bunch rather than the Lorentz factor of the fastest electrons. The theoretical scaling relations developed here suggest, for example, that with a 20-PW 800-nm driving laser, 1 TW/harmonic can be produced for 1-keV photons.},

The sensitivity of imaging plate sensitivity to x-ray radiation was examined using radioactive Co-60 isotope. Furthermore, the fading and decay mechanism affected by phosphor stimulated process were also investigated by employing the high energy gamma-rays produced in laser-plasma experiment. Finally, an ion spectrometer was designed to examine the IP response to different ion energies during a laser-driven plasma experiment. The universal relation given, can be used to evaluate the response of the imaging plate against any other types of radiation.},

Using the RES principle, we derive a closed set of differential equations that describe the reflection of radiation with arbitrary variation of polarization and intensity from plasma with an arbitrary density profile for an arbitrary angle of incidence. We confirm with ab initio PIC simulations that the developed theory accurately describes laser-plasma interactions in the regime where the reflection of relativistically strong radiation is accompanied by significant, repeated relocation of plasma electrons. In particular, the theory can be applied for the studies of plasma heating and coherent and incoherent emissions in the RES regime of high-intensity laser-plasma interaction.},

  abstract = {The generation of ultrastrong attosecond pulses through laser-plasma interactions offers the opportunity to surpass the intensity of any known laboratory radiation source, giving rise to new experimental possibilities, such as quantum electrodynamical tests and matter probing at extremely short scales. Here we demonstrate that a laser irradiated plasma surface can act as an efficient converter from the femto- to the attosecond range, giving a dramatic rise in pulse intensity. Although seemingly similar schemes have been described in the literature, the present setup differs significantly from the previous attempts. We present a model describing the nonlinear process of relativistic laser-plasma interaction. This model, which is applicable to a multitude of phenomena, is shown to be in excellent agreement with particle-in-cell simulations. The model makes it possible to determine a parameter region where the energy conversion from the femto- to the attosecond regime is maximal. Based on the study we propose a concept of laser pulse interaction with a target having a groove-shaped surface, which opens up the potential to exceed an intensity level of 1026 W/cm2 and observe effects due to nonlinear quantum electrodynamics with upcoming laser sources.},

Two such instruments, dubbed OHREX-1 and OHREX-2, are fielded for plasma diagnostics at the Orion laser facility in the United Kingdom. The OHREX spectrometer can simultaneously house two spherically bent crystals with a radius of curvature of r = 67.2 cm. The focusing properties of the spectrometer allow both for larger distance to the source due to the increase in collected light and for observation of extended sources. OHREX is designed to cover a 2.5\textdegree\textendash 3\textdegree{} spectral range at Bragg angles around 51.3\textdegree. The typically high resolving powers at these large Bragg angles are ideally suited for line shape diagnostics. For instance, the nominal resolving power of the instrument (\&gt;10\,000) is much higher than the effective resolving power associated with the Doppler broadening due to the temperature of the trapped ions in EBIT-I. The effective resolving power is only around 3000 at typical EBIT-I conditions, which nevertheless is sufficient to set up and test the instrument's spectral characteristics. We have calibrated the spectral range for a number of crystals using well known reference lines in the first and second order and derived the ion temperatures from these lines. We have also made use of the 50 {$\mu$}m size of the EBIT-I source width to characterize the spatial focusing of the spectrometer.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

These bunches are acquired from the interaction of an ultra-short ultra-intense laser pulse with a cone target. The laser oscillating field pulls out the cone surface electrons periodically and accelerates them forward via laser pondermotive force. The inner cone wall can effectively guide these bunches and lead to their stable propagation in the cone, resulting in overdense energetic attosecond electron generation. We also consider the influence of laser and cone target parameters on the bunch properties. It indicates that the attosecond electron bunch acceleration and propagation could be significantly enhanced without evident divergency by attaching a plasma capillary to the original cone tip.},

Here we derive the limit density for HB, which is the maximum plasma density the laser can reach, as a function of laser intensity. The time scale for when the laser pulse reaches the limit density is also derived. These theories are confirmed by a series of particle-in-cell simulations. After reaching the limit density, the plasma starts to blowout back toward the laser, and is accompanied by copious superthermal electrons; therefore, the electron energy can be determined by varying the laser pulse length.},

Electrons quivering in laser pulse experience radiation reaction (RR) recoil force by radiating photons. When the laser field reaches the threshold, the RR force becomes significant enough to compensate for the expelling laser ponderomotive force. Then electrons are trapped inside the laser pulse instead of being scattered off transversely and form a dense plasma bunch. The mechanism is demonstrated both by full three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations using the QED photonic approach and numerical test-particle modeling based on the classical Landau-Lifshitz formula of RR force. Furthermore, the proposed analysis shows that the threshold of laser field amplitude for RRT is approximately the cubic root of laser wavelength over classical electron radius. Because of the pinching effect of the trapped electron bunch, the required laser intensity for RRT can be further reduced.},

  abstract = {High-harmonic radiation can be generated when an ultra-intense laser beam is reflected from an over-dense plasma, known as a plasma mirror. It is considered a promising technique for generating intense attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray wavelength ranges. However, a solid target used for the formation of the over-dense plasma is completely damaged by the interaction. Thus, it is challenging to use a solid target for applications such as time-resolved studies and attosecond streaking experiments that require a large amount of data. Here we demonstrate that high-harmonic radiation can be continuously generated from a liquid plasma mirror in both the coherent wake emission and relativistic oscillating mirror regimes. These results will pave the way for the development of bright, stable, and high-repetition-rate attosecond light sources, which can greatly benefit the study of ultrafast laser-matter interactions.},

  abstract = {We investigate the heating effects of high harmonics of an ultra-intense laser pulse, generated by the interaction of the pulse on an over-dense plasma mirror, incident on an aluminium target. In the regime where the Zero Vector Potential (ZVP) absorption mechanism dominates, the production of these harmonics is expected to be more efficient. Taking a well-established harmonic intensity scaling relationship from previous work, we use input specifications of the forthcoming ELI Beamlines laser facility and results from a complementary project to estimate the intensity-time profiles of the high harmonics. The radiative-hydrodynamic code Helios is then used to simulate the incidence of these high harmonics onto a tamped aluminium target. Here we define 'high harmonics' as being harmonics 15 and above of the fundamental incident laser pulse on the plasma mirror. Simulations of sequential pairs of harmonic orders in the range 15 to 46 yield two major results: the bulk aluminium target temperature can be driven to several keV when large ranges of harmonics are incident simultaneously, and the heating effect of a single pair of harmonics is much greater when the pair is incident alongside lower harmonics rather than in isolation. These results are encouraging for the use of harmonics as a heating source and warrant a further campaign of simulations to optimise the target setup and incident harmonic range ahead of potential experiments on current petawatt-class laser facilities.},

The modification is considered as being produced by spreading out the charge distribution of a particle to make a particle of finite size R (cloud). These clouds move freely through one another and interact through normal electromagnetic fields. A method to adapt point-particle results for plasma oscillations, shielding, fluctuations, and collisions, is shown, and the modifications to these plasma properties discussed in detail. The relevance of these considerations to computer simulation of plasmas (in which some smoothing is a consequence of the numerical methods used and additional smoothing is sometimes added) is discussed. It is found that smoothing the short wavelength interaction can be used without destroying the desired physics, while suppressing collisional effects and noise at wavelengths \&lt; R which are exaggerated in simulation due to the use of far fewer particles than in a real plasma.},

PIC methods are widely used in all aspects of plasma physics, proving to be a precious and irreplaceable tool. Yet all methods in use and published conserve energy to a good approximation, but not exactly. A well known property of PIC methods, documented extensively in all textbooks, is that energy is not conserved exactly. In fact, the particle noise is a unphysical source of energy that, when insufficient resolution is used, can make the simulations go unstable. In the present paper, we apply a new exactly energy conserving scheme and demonstrate that indeed exact energy conservation plays a key role in determining the correct spectrum of the accelerated particles.},

PHYCHOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT OF HIGH-ORDER HARMONIC BEAMS GENERATED ON PLASMA MIRRORS Experimental setup The measurements were performed at CEA Saclay using the UHI100 laser (100 TW, 25fs FWHM). As a very accurate control on the plasma expansion at the target surface is required, the temporal contrast is enhanced before the interaction using a double plasma mirror system, to reach values higher than 10 12 at times {$\tau$} {$>$} 10 ps before the main pulse. Two 1/2 inch diameter mirrors are inserted on the edges of the laser beam (3 inches diameter), in front of one of the large mirrors used to steer the main beam, in order to select two small parts of this beam and generate two prepulses focused on target at controllable delays {$\tau$} 1 and {$\tau$} 2 before the main pulse (typically a few picoseconds). These three pulses are focused on target using an off-axis parabolic mirror of focal length f = 500mm. As illustrated on Fig.S1 a, when {$\delta\tau$} = {$\tau$} 1 - {$\tau$} 2 = 0f s, the two prepulse beams interfere on the target surface. A slight variation in {$\delta\tau$} by a fraction of the laser period T L leads to a shift of the position of the fringes in this interference pattern. A larger variation, of a fraction of the pulse duration {$\tau$} L , changes the contrast of the interference fringes. The fringe spacing depends on the angle between the two focused prepulse beams: it is equal to d = 22\textmu m here. The maximum intensity on target of the prepulse beams focal spot is about 2.10 16 W/cm 2. The generated structured plasma, so-called transient plasma grating, then expends into the vacuum for a delay {$\tau$} d = 0.5({$\tau$} 1 + {$\tau$} 2), with a typical velocity of L/{$\tau$} d {$\sim$} 50 - 60nm/ps and depth of {$\delta$}L/L 20\%. This velocity is measured with the diagnostic described in [1], and the depth as described in [2]. As illustrated on Fig.S1 b, after a delay {$\tau$} d , the main beam impinges the transient plasma grating and drives high order harmonic generation. The control of the generation process is performed using a diaphragm of adjustable diameter: for the ROM mechanism, the whole beam is focused on target, leading to a focal spot (see Fig.S1 b) of waist w L = 6.2\textmu m and a maximum laser amplitude of a 0 1.5 - 2 at maximum laser power. For the CWE process, a 1-inch diameter diaphragm is introduced in the main beam before focusing, leading to a focal spot of waist w L = 14.5\textmu m and maximum laser amplitude of a 0 0.18 - 0.25.},

Each crystal has a nominal radius of curvature of R = 67.2 cm and is fielded at a nominal Bragg angle of 51.3\textdegree. To cover different bands of interest, several different crystals are available, including Ge (111), KAP, and several cuts of quartz, whose resolving power {$\lambda$}/{$\Delta$} {$\lambda$} exceeds 10 000. The calibrated response of the available crystals has previously been reported from measurements at the EBIT-I electron beam ion trap at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

The electron beam spatial distribution and spectrum were investigated as a function of the plasma scale length, which was varied by deliberately introducing a moderate-intensity prepulse. At the optimum scale length of {$\lambda$}/2, the electrons are emitted in a collimated beam having a quasimonoenergetic distribution that peaked at {$\sim$}0.8MeV. A highly reproducible structure in the spatial distribution exhibits an evacuation of electrons along the laser specular direction and suggests that the electron beam duration is comparable to that of the laser pulse. Particle-in-cell simulations which are in good agreement with the experimental results offer insights on the acceleration mechanism by the laser field. \textcopyright{} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Short wavelengths birth shorter ones                            The shortest laser pulses\textemdash with durations measured in attoseconds\textemdash arise from a process termed high-harmonic generation (HHG). Essentially, a longer, ``driving'' pulse draws electrons out of gaseous atoms like a slingshot, and, when they ricochet back, light emerges at shorter wavelengths. Most HHG has been carried out using light near the visible/infrared boundary for the driving pulse. Popmintchev               et al.               used an ultraviolet driving pulse instead, which yielded an unexpectedly efficient outcome. These results could presage a more generally efficient means of creating x-ray pulses for fundamental dynamics studies as well as technological applications.                                         Science               , this issue p. 1225                        ,              Ultraviolet pulses show unexpected efficiency in generating the higher-frequency emission underlying attosecond spectroscopy.           ,              High-harmonic generation is a universal response of matter to strong femtosecond laser fields, coherently upconverting light to much shorter wavelengths. Optimizing the conversion of laser light into soft x-rays typically demands a trade-off between two competing factors. Because of reduced quantum diffusion of the radiating electron wave function, the emission from each species is highest when a short-wavelength ultraviolet driving laser is used. However, phase matching\textemdash the constructive addition of x-ray waves from a large number of atoms\textemdash favors longer-wavelength mid-infrared lasers. We identified a regime of high-harmonic generation driven by 40-cycle ultraviolet lasers in waveguides that can generate bright beams in the soft x-ray region of the spectrum, up to photon energies of 280 electron volts. Surprisingly, the high ultraviolet refractive indices of both neutral atoms and ions enabled effective phase matching, even in a multiply ionized plasma. We observed harmonics with very narrow linewidths, while calculations show that the x-rays emerge as nearly time-bandwidth\textendash limited pulse trains of \textasciitilde 100 attoseconds.},

The ab initio full electromagnetic relativistic PIC codes provide the most reliable description of plasmas, and their properties are described in detail. However, while they represent the most fundamental model, full PIC codes are computationally expensive. Plasma-based acceleration is a multi-scale problem with very disparate scales. The smallest scale is the laser or plasma wavelength (on the order of one to a hundred microns), and the largest scale is the acceleration distance (which ranges from a few centimetres to metres or even kilometres). The Lorentz boost technique allows the scale disparity to be reduced, at the cost of complicating the simulations and causing unphysical numerical instabilities in the code. Another possibility is to use the quasi-static approximation, whereby the different scales are separated analytically.},

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts that the properties of the fermionic quantum vacuum can be probed by extremely large electromagnetic fields. The typical field amplitudes required correspond to the onset of the 'optical breakdown' of this vacuum, expected at light intensities {$>$}4.7\texttimes 1029 W/cm2. Approaching this 'Schwinger limit' would enable testing of major but still unverified predictions of QED. Yet, the Schwinger limit is seven orders of magnitude above the present record in light intensity achieved by high-power lasers. To close this considerable gap, a promising paradigm consists of reflecting these laser beams off a mirror in relativistic motion, to induce a Doppler effect that compresses the light pulse in time down to the attosecond range and converts it to shorter wavelengths, which can then be focused much more tightly than the initial laser light. However, this faces a major experimental hurdle: how to generate such relativistic mirrors? In this article, we explain how this challenge could nowadays be tackled by using so-called 'relativistic plasma mirrors'. We argue that approaching the Schwinger limit in the coming years by applying this scheme to the latest generation of petawatt-class lasers is a challenging but realistic objective.},

The seed pulse was amplified by a factor of more than 20\,000 from the input in a 2mm long plasma, which also exceeded the intensity of the pump pulse by 2 orders of magnitude. This was accompanied by very effective pulse compression, from 500fsto90fs in the first pass measurements and in the second pass down to approximately 50fs, as it is indicated by the energy-pulse duration relation. Further improvements to the energy transfer efficiency and the SRBS performance by extending the region of resonance is also discussed where a uniform {$\sim$}4mm long plasma channel for SRBS was generated by using two subsequent laser pulses in an ethane gas jet.},

However, the energy limitation of these lasers supports only weak sources and correspondingly linear attosecond studies. Here we report on an optical parametric synthesizer designed for nonlinear attosecond optics and relativistic laser-plasma physics. This synthesizer uniquely combines ultra-relativistic focused intensities of about 10               20               \,W/cm               2               with a pulse duration of sub-two carrier-wave cycles. The coherent combination of two sequentially amplified and complementary spectral ranges yields sub-5-fs pulses with multi-TW peak power. The application of this source allows the generation of a broad spectral continuum at 100-eV photon energy in gases as well as high-order harmonics in relativistic plasmas. Unprecedented spatio-temporal confinement of light now permits the investigation of electric-field-driven electron phenomena in the relativistic regime and ultimately the rise of next-generation intense isolated attosecond sources.},

These absolute measurements cover a continuous and broad spectral range that extends from 4.75 to 7.3 \AA{} (1.7-2.6 keV). The x-ray spectrum consists of spectral line transitions from highly charged ions and broadband emission with contributions from recombination and free-free processes that occur when electrons decelerate in plasma electromagnetic fields. Angular distribution of the emission was investigated via particle-in-cell simulations, which allowed to estimate the yield into the full solid angle. We find that experimental and simulation estimations of laser to free-free emission CE are in good agreement.},

  abstract = {A novel non-ponderomotive absorption mechanism, originally presented by Baeva et al. [Phys. Plasmas 18, 056702 (2011)] in one dimension, is extended into higher dimensions for the first time. This absorption mechanism, the Zero Vector Potential (ZVP), is expected to dominate the interactions of ultra-intense laser pulses with critically over-dense plasmas such as those that are expected with the Extreme Light Infrastructure laser systems. It is shown that the mathematical form of the ZVP mechanism and its key scaling relations found by Baeva et al. in 1D are identically reproduced in higher dimensions. The two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are then used to validate both the qualitative and quantitative predictions of the theory.},

  abstract = {A theoretical and numerical investigation of non-ponderomotive absorption at laser intensities relevant to quantum electrodynamics is presented. It is predicted that there is a regime change in the dependence of fast electron energy on incident laser energy that coincides with the onset of pair production via the Breit-Wheeler process. This prediction is numerically verified via an extensive campaign of QED-inclusive particle-in-cell simulations. The dramatic nature of the power law shift leads to the conclusion that this process is a candidate for an unambiguous signature that future experiments on multi-petawatt laser facilities have truly entered the QED regime.},

This field structure can both extract the electrons from the target and accelerate them. It is theoretically shown that the acceleration is possible and stable for a wide range of electron initial conditions. PIC simulations confirm that this mechanism can actually take place for realistic parameters. As a result, the electron bunches with charge of tens of nC and GeV-level energy can be produced using a laser intensity \$10\^\{21\}-10\^\{22\}\$ W/cm\$\{\}\^2\$. It is also shown that the presence of a preplasma can increase the acceleration rate, which becomes possible because of more efficient electron injection into the accelerating field structure.},

In existing theories, the dominant heating mechanism is that of resistive heating by the neutralizing return current. In addition to this, we find that large amplitude plasma waves are induced in the plasma in the wake of relativistic electron bunches. The subsequent collisional damping of these waves represents a source of heating that can exceed the resistive heating rate. As a result, solid targets heat significantly faster than has been previously considered. A new hybrid model, capable of reproducing these results, is described.},

The efficiency of laser energy transfer into these electrons depends on multiple parameters including the focused intensity and pre-plasma level. This paper reports experimental results from the interaction of a high intensity petawatt-class glass laser pulses with solid targets at a maximum intensity of 1019 W cm-2. In-situ measurements of specularly reflected light are used to provide an upper bound of laser absorption and to characterize focused laser intensity, the pre-plasma level and the generation mechanism of second harmonic light. The measured spectrum of electrons and bremsstrahlung radiation provide information about the efficiency of laser energy transfer.},

The seed pulses are produced by HHG in rare gases in the loose-focusing regime, driven by a high-power kHz laser system. Continuous tunability is achieved by varying the wavelength of the drive laser over 25 nm from the 800 nm centre wavelength. Future prospects for increasing the HHG yield and short wavelength cut-off by using multi-wavelength generation schemes and longer drive wavelengths are considered, as is the potential for FEL seeding at higher repetition rates.\textcopyright{} 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

The aim is to make manageable what would otherwise be regarded as hard; to make derivations as simple as possible and physical ideas as transparent as possible. Lorentz invariants and four-vectors are introduced early on, but tensor notation is postponed until needed. In addition to the more basic ideas such as Doppler effect and collisions, the text introduces more advanced material such as radiation from accelerating charges, Lagrangian methods, the stress-energy tensor, and introductory General Relativity, including Gaussian curvature, the Schwarzschild solution, gravitational lensing, and black holes. A second volume will extend the treatment of General Relativity somewhat more thoroughly, and also introduce Cosmology, spinors, and some field theory.},

  abstract = {For the future progress of nonlinear attosecond science, one of the most important issues is the development of highenergy isolated attosecond pulse sources. In this paper, we review our research on the energy-scaling method for isolated attosecond pulse generation, which combines infrared two-color gating and an energy-scaling method of high-order harmonic generation. By establishing the robust energy-scaling method, the maximum pulse energy of the isolated attosecond pulse reaches 1.3 {$\mu$}J/pulse in the XUV region, which is almost 100-fold higher than the values ever reported before. The pulse duration of this isolated attosecond pulse is directly measured to be 500 as by the autocorrelation method using the nonlinear interaction of N2 . This nonlinear experiment clearly shows that our developed isolated attosecond pulse has enough pulse energy to make a breakthrough for nonlinear attosecond metrology as well as for attosecond-pump/attosecondprobe experiments investigating electronic processes. In addition, we further extend the high-energy harmonic continuum by using the infrared two-color gating method up to the soft-x-ray region. With the aim to temporally characterize an isolated attosecond pulse in the soft-x-ray region, we demonstrate the first observation of above-threshold ionization of He with two-photon absorption of multiple higher harmonics in the soft-x-ray region.},

The ELI project consists of three pillars being built in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania. This challenging proposal is based on recent technical progress allowing ultraintense laser fields in which intensities will soon be reaching as high as I0 {$\sim$} 1023 W cm-2. This tremendous technological advance has been brought about by the invention of chirped pulse amplification by Mourou and Strickland. Romania is hosting the ELI for Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) pillar in M\u{a}gurele near Bucharest. The new facility, currently under construction, is intended to serve the broad national, European, and international scientific community. Its mission covers scientific research at the frontier of knowledge involving two domains. The first is laser-driven experiments related to NP, strong-field quantum electrodynamics, and associated vacuum effects. The second research domain is based on the establishment of a Compton-backscattering-based, high-brilliance, and intense {$\gamma$} beam with E{$\gamma$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 19.5 MeV, which represents a merger between laser and accelerator technology. This system will allow the investigation of the nuclear structure of selected isotopes and nuclear reactions of relevance, for example, to astrophysics with hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy. In addition to fundamental themes, a large number of applications with significant societal impact will be developed. The implementation of the project started in January 2013 and is spearheaded by the ELI-NP/Horia Hulubei National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH). Experiments will begin in early 2020.},

Among the various schemes proposed for electrons, vacuum laser acceleration has attracted considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of its appealing simplicity: electrons interact with an intense laser field in vacuum and can be continuously accelerated, provided they remain at a given phase of the field until they escape the laser beam. But demonstrating this effect experimentally has proved extremely challenging, as it imposes stringent requirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field. Here, we solve this long-standing experimental problem by using a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field, and obtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration. With the advent of petawatt lasers, this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high charge (nC) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams.},

The main findings are (1) an LPA driven in the blowout regime by 30 TW, 30\,fs laser pulses produce not only a high-quality, tunable, quasi-monoenergetic electron beam, but also a high-quality, relativistically intense (a0 {$\sim$} 1) spent drive pulse that remains stable in profile and intensity over the LPA tuning range. (2) A thin plastic film near the gas jet exit retro-reflects the spent drive pulse efficiently into oncoming electrons to produce CBS x-rays without detectable bremsstrahlung background. Meanwhile, anomalous far-field divergence of the retro-reflected light demonstrates relativistic ``denting'' of the PM. Exploiting these optimized LPA and PM conditions, we demonstrate quasi-monoenergetic (50\% FWHM energy spread), tunable (75\textendash 200\,KeV) CBS x-rays, characteristics previously achieved only on more powerful laser systems by CBS of a split-off, counter-propagating pulse. Moreover, laser-to-x-ray photon conversion efficiency ({$\sim$}6\,\texttimes\,10-12) exceeds that of any previous LPA-based quasi-monoenergetic Compton source. Particle-in-cell simulations agree well with the measurements.},

The most promising of these are known as plasma mirrors, formed when an intense femtosecond laser ionizes a solid surface. These mirrors specularly reflect the main part of a laser pulse and can be used as active optical elements to manipulate its temporal and spatial properties. Unfortunately, the considerable pressures exerted by the laser can deform the mirror surface, unfavourably affecting the reflected beam and complicating, or even preventing, the use of plasma mirrors at ultrahigh intensities. Here we derive a simple analytical model of the basic physics involved in laser-induced deformation of a plasma mirror. We validate this model numerically and experimentally, and use it to show how such deformation might be mitigated by appropriate control of the laser phase. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the effects of ion motion on the generation of harmonics have only recently started to be considered. Here, we study the effects of ion motion in harmonics production at ultrahigh laser intensities interacting with solid density plasma. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we find that there is an optimum density for harmonic production that depends on laser intensity, which scales linearly with a{$<$}inf{$>$}0{$<$}/inf{$>$} with no ion motion but with a reduced scaling if ion motion is included. We derive a scaling for this optimum density with ion motion and also find that the background ion motion induces Doppler red-shifts in the harmonic structures of the reflected pulse. The temporal structure of the Doppler shifts is correlated to the envelope of the incident laser pulse. We demonstrate that by introducing a frequency chirp in the incident pulse we are able to eliminate these Doppler shifts almost completely.},

The necessary high spatial coherence is currently provided by either large-scale synchrotron facilities with limited beamtime access or by microfocus X-ray tubes with rather limited flux. X-rays radiated by relativistic electrons driven by well-controlled high-power lasers offer a promising route to a proliferation of this powerful imaging technology. A laser-driven plasma wave accelerates and wiggles electrons, giving rise to a brilliant keV X-ray emission. This so-called betatron radiation is emitted in a collimated beam with excellent spatial coherence and remarkable spectral stability. Here we present a phase-contrast microtomogram of a biological sample using betatron X-rays. Comprehensive source characterization enables the reconstruction of absolute electron densities. Our results suggest that laser-based X-ray technology offers the potential for filling the large performance gap between synchrotron- and current X-ray tube-based sources.},

  abstract = {We use simulations to investigate the interaction of ultra-intense laser pulses with a plasma. With an intensity greater than 10' W/cm, these pulses have a pressure greater than l0 Mbar and drive the plasma relativistically. Hole boring by the light beam is a key feature of the interaction. We find substantial absorption into heated electrons with a characteristic temperature of order the ponderomotive potential. Other eAects include a dependence on the polarization of the incident light, strong magnetic field generation, and a period of intense instability generation in the underdense plasma. PACS numbers: 52.40.Nk, 52.35.Nx, 52.60.+h The ongoing development of ultrabright, short pulse lasers is allowing exploration of new regimes of laser-matter interaction. Experiments are now being carried out [1-3] in which plasmas are irradiated by laser light with intensities up to lk"=10' Wpm /cm. Here I is the intensity and A, " the wavelength in microns. At such intensities, electrons oscillating in the field of the light wave are strongly relativistic; i.e. , p, bmoc \textasciitilde{} I, where p" is the momentum of oscillation, mo the electron mass, and c the velocity of light. This is the first simulation study to address an ultra-intense light wave with a finite spot size normally incident onto an overdense plasma-vacuum interface. Some of the key results are strong hole punching and MeV ion generation inward due to the large light pressure, MeV electron generation into the overdense plasma by nonadiabatic heating at the sharp light-plasma interface, and estimates for the absorption of the incident light and characteristic temperature of heated electrons for a range of laser intensities soon to be experimentally accessible. We use a 2D, electromagnetic, relativistic electron, mobile ion, particle-in-cell code (ZOHAR [4]) to study this relatively unexplored, highly nonlinear regime [5]. As with previous ID studies at lower intensities [61, these simulations model the interaction of laser light with a col-lisionless plasma. For the intensities and time scales studied here, inverse bremsstrahlung is weak since the light-plasma interface is quite steep and the effective temperature of the electrons interacting with the light wave is large. We begin with a simulation which focuses on the interaction of high-intensity laser light with a preformed, overdense plasma. Laser light with a Gaussian intensity profile (in the transverse or y dimension) is introduced at the left boundary and propagates (in the x direction) through a region of vacuum onto a slab of overdense plasma. Particles escaping through the right boundary are reemitted with their original temperature. In this example , the system is 36c/cuit long in the x direction and 40c/coo wide, where roti is the light-wave frequency. The plasma is initially 22c/ton long, preceded by 14c/too of vacuum. The electric field of the incident light wave is in the y direction, and the dynamics are followed in the x-y plane (the so-called p-polarized case). In complementary simulations, the electric field is in the z direction (the s-polarized case). We consider both cases to provide insight into the three-dimensional aspects of the problem, which wi11 be a mixture of the two cases. The initial density of the plasma slab is 4n", where n" is the critical density for the incident wave. The initial electron temperature 8, is 4 keV, and the electron-ion mass ratio is 1/1836. The incident wave is turned on over 72taii ' and has a Gaussian transverse intensity profile with half-width of 14c/roti, with a peak intensity of 11"=1. 2\&\&10' Wpm2/cm2. This intensity corresponds to p,Jmtic =3. The intense, linearly polarized light wave strikes the overdense plasma and penetrates a thin layer somewhat larger than c/ ztodue to the relativistic mass change [7]. (Here to\textasciitilde{} is the electron plasma frequency.) Even for normal incidence, there is a very strong, high-frequency electrostatic field operating on the plasma in this interface. This field is simply the oscillating component of the ponderomotive force [8] fz, f\textasciitilde{} =V(y-I)mac, where y = (1+ p /mti) 'l and p is the electron oscillatory momentum in the transverse and longitudinal fields of the wave. Although generally nonresonant, this field can still accelerate electrons [9] which interact nonadiabatically with it in the steep interface. The frequency of the oscillating ponderomotive force is 2coo. This means that twice every cycle, a group of electrons will be accelerated into the plasma by this ponderomotive force. This will show up as a "train" of high-energy electrons, separated by a distance of half of a laser wavelength, or-trc/coti. The heating is apparent in Fig. 1(a), which is a snapshot of p" vs x of the electrons at topt =180. Figure 1(b) shows the energy spectrum of the heated electrons which have transported through the right boundary by coot =400. Note that these heated electrons have an effective temperature of about 1.1 MeV. At this time about 26\% of tke incident light-wave energy is being absorbed into these electrons. Boring of the light beam into the plasma is a very important feature of the interaction. The light pressure pL is extremely high; i.e. , pL, =2I/c-6X 10 Mbar for, say, I=10' W/cm. The hole punching is apparent in Fig 2(a), which is a snapshot of the ion charge density at coat =183. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the depth of the O\&},

We are developing an upgrade to deliver 20PW peak intensity pulses to enable, for example, ultrarelativistic phenomena and studies of high intensity quantum electrodynamics. Increasing the energy is not practical in a single beam geometry due to already reaching the laser induced damage threshold on meter scale gratings, leading to the adoption of shorter and thus larger bandwidth pulses. The Vulcan 20PW upgrade is based on the generation of 820--1000nm (sub20fs compressed) pulses from a novel chirpedpulse compensated optical parametric chirped pulse amplifier (CPOPCPA) \textbackslash [1\textbackslash ]: broadband collinear phase matching is achieved by appropriately chirping the pump and seed such that at any moment in time, the instantaneous frequencies of the pump and signal are perfectly phase matched (Fig. 1a). Since the scheme is collinear, the idler (which is used to seed the power amplifiers) does not exhibit any angular dispersion, compared to noncollinear schemes more typically employed. Tunability of the idler spectrum can be achieved by selection of the pump/signal frequencies and crystal phase matching angle.}

  abstract = {We present a recent progress of the SG-II 5PW facility, which designed a multi-petawatt ultrashort pulse laser based on optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA). The prior two optical parametric amplifiers have been accomplished and chirped pulses with an energy of 49.7 J and a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) spectrum bandwidth of 85 nm have been achieved. In the PW-scale optical parametric amplification (OPA), with the pump pulse that has an energy of 118 J from the second harmonic generation of the SG-II 7th beam, the pump-to-signal conversion efficiency is up to 41.9\%, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest among all of the reported values for OPCPA systems. The compressed pulse is higher than 37 J in 21 fs (1.76 PW), and the focal spot is {$\sim$}10 \textmu m after the closed-loop corrections by the adaptive optics. Limited by the repetition of the pump laser, the SG-II 5PW facility operates one shot per hour. It has successfully been employed for high energy physics experiments.},

  abstract = {The scaling of the intensity, angular and material dependence of bremsstrahlung radiation from an intense (I {$>$} 1018 W cm-2) laser\textendash solid interaction has been characterized at energies between 100 keV and 1 MeV. These are the first high resolution (E/{$\Delta$}E {$>$} 200) measurements of bremsstrahlung photons from a relativistic laser\textendash plasma interaction. The measurement was performed using a high purity germanium detector at the high-repetition rate (500 Hz) {$\lambda$}3 laser facility. The bremsstrahlung spectra were observed to have a two effective temperature energy distribution which ranged between 80 ({$\pm$} 10) and 550 ({$\pm$} 60) keV depending on laser intensity and observation angle. The two temperatures were determined to result from separate populations of accelerated electrons. One population was isotropic and produced the lower effective bremsstrahlung temperature. The higher bremsstrahlung temperature was produced by an energetic electron beam directed out of the front of the target in the direction of the specular laser reflection, which was also the direction the bremsstrahlung effective temperature peaked. Both effective bremsstrahlung temperatures scaled consistently with a previously measured experimental electron temperature scaling on {$\lambda$}3. The electron populations and bremsstrahlung temperatures were modeled in the particle-in-cell code OSIRIS and the Monte Carlo code MCNPX and were in good agreement with the experimental results. The observed directionality and intensity scaling suggest a significant difference between picosecond and femtosecond duration pulse interactions.},
