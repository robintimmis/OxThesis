  abstract = {We have proposed an efficient scheme of generation of short dense electron bunches during the interaction at large angles of incidence of a laser pulse with a thin transversally semibounded laser target. Streams of bunches can be used to simultaneously and independently generate pulsed X-ray radiation as fast electrons hit secondary targets. Dependences of bunch parameters (the number of particles in the bunch and the bunch energy and thickness) on the angle of incidence and laser intensity have been obtained. It has been shown that, upon reflection from the target, the relativistic-intensity laser wave is efficiently converted (the energy-conversion factor reaches {$\sim$}20\%) into a sequence of electromagnetic tens-of-nanometer-long atto pulses, which follow one after another in the period of the initial laser wave. We have investigated how the parameters of the atto pulse depend on the angle of incidence and the laser intensity. We have shown that atto pulses are generated most efficiently at large angles of incidence ({$\geq$}50) of the laser pulse on the target. \textcopyright{} 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

A promising\textemdash yet challenging\textemdash approach to achieve such extreme fields consists in reflecting a high-power femtosecond laser pulse off a curved relativistic mirror. This enhances the intensity of the reflected beam by simultaneously compressing it in time down to the attosecond range, and focusing it to submicrometre focal spots. Here we show that such curved relativistic mirrors can be produced when an ultra-intense laser pulse ionizes a solid target and creates a dense plasma that specularly reflects the incident light. This is evidenced by measuring the temporal and spatial effects induced on the reflected beam by this so-called plasma mirror. The all-optical measurement technique demonstrated here will be instrumental for the use of relativistic plasma mirrors with the upcoming generation of petawatt lasers that recently reached intensities of 5 \texttimes{} 1022 W cm-2, and therefore constitutes a viable experimental path to the Schwinger limit.},

High-order harmonic generation (HOHG) using short pulse ({$<$}100 fs) infrared lasers focused to intensities surpassing 1018 W cm -2 onto a solid density plasma is a promising means of generating such short pulses. Critical to the relativistic oscillating mirror mechanism is the steepness of the plasma density gradient at the reflection point, characterized by a scale length, which can strongly influence the harmonic generation mechanism. It is shown that for intensities in excess of 1021 W cm-2 an optimum density ramp scale length exists that balances an increase in efficiency with a growth of parametric plasma wave instabilities. We show that for these higher intensities the optimal scale length is c/{$\omega$}0, for which a variety of HOHG properties are optimized, including total conversion efficiency, HOHG divergence, and their power law scaling. Particle-in-cell simulations show striking evidence of the HOHG loss mechanism through parametric instabilities and relativistic self-phase modulation, which affect the produced spectra and conversion efficiency. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Physical Society.},

Until now, it has been unclear whether the conditions necessary to exploit such phenomena can survive such an extreme interaction with increasing laser intensity. Here, we provide the first quantitative evidence to suggest that they can. We show that the occurrence of surface smoothing on the scale of the wavelength of the generated harmonics, and plasma denting of the irradiated surface, enables the production of high-quality X-ray beams focused down to the diffraction limit.

Theoretical work, however, has shown an alternative method for achieving this goal: dense nanobunch formation and acceleration on timescales of less than an optical laser cycle ({$\sim$}10 -15 s) during relativistic laser-plasma interactions. This opens up the exciting potential for developing a new bright ultrafast extreme ultraviolet XUV/x-ray source. Here we demonstrate, using a previously unexplored geometry, coherent synchrotron emission generated during relativistically intense laser-ultrathin foil interactions which extends to {$\sim$}1 keV photon energies. Particle-in-cell code simulations reveal how periodic sub-laser cycle acceleration of dense nanobunches of electrons formed during normal incidence interactions result in bursts of bright attosecond radiation in transmission and how these pulses relate to plasma density scalelength. This work shows clear potential for a novel, intense source of attosecond XUV ({$\sim$}10-18 s) radiation. Experimentally, high order (n) harmonic spectra (I(n)) are characterized by a slow decay (n-1.62 ) before a rapid efficiency rollover.

Relativistic plasma mirrors generate broadband power-law spectra, that may span the gap between petawatt-class infrared laser facilities and x-ray free-electron lasers; despite substantial theoretical work the ultimate efficiency of this relativistic high-order-harmonic generation remains unclear. We show that the coherent radiation emitted by plasma mirrors follows a power-law distribution of energy over frequency with an exponent that, even in the ultrarelativistic limit, strongly depends on the ratio of laser intensity to plasma density and exceeds the frequently quoted value of -8/3 over a wide range of parameters. The coherent synchrotron emission model, when adequately corrected for the finite width of emitting electron bunches, is not just valid for p-polarized light and thin foil targets, but generally describes relativistic harmonic generation, including at normal incidence and with finite-gradient plasmas. Our numerical results support the {$\omega-$}4/3 scaling of the synchrotron emission model as a limiting efficiency of the process under most conditions. The highest frequencies that can be generated with this scaling are usually restricted by the width of the emitting electron bunch rather than the Lorentz factor of the fastest electrons. The theoretical scaling relations developed here suggest, for example, that with a 20-PW 800-nm driving laser, 1 TW/harmonic can be produced for 1-keV photons.},

  abstract = {We consider the reflection of relativistically strong radiation from plasma and identify the physical origin of the electrons' tendency to form a thin sheet, which maintains its localisation throughout its motion. Thereby, we justify the principle of relativistic electronic spring (RES) proposed in [Gonoskov et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 046403 (2011)]. Using the RES principle, we derive a closed set of differential equations that describe the reflection of radiation with arbitrary variation of polarization and intensity from plasma with an arbitrary density profile for an arbitrary angle of incidence. We confirm with ab initio PIC simulations that the developed theory accurately describes laser-plasma interactions in the regime where the reflection of relativistically strong radiation is accompanied by significant, repeated relocation of plasma electrons. In particular, the theory can be applied for the studies of plasma heating and coherent and incoherent emissions in the RES regime of high-intensity laser-plasma interaction.},

  abstract = {High-power lasers in the relativistic intensity regime with multi-picosecond pulse durations are available in many laboratories around the world. Laser pulses at these intensities reach giga-bar level radiation pressures, which can push the plasma critical surface where laser light is reflected. This process is referred to as the laser hole boring (HB), which is critical for plasma heating, hence essential for laser-based applications. Here we derive the limit density for HB, which is the maximum plasma density the laser can reach, as a function of laser intensity. The time scale for when the laser pulse reaches the limit density is also derived. These theories are confirmed by a series of particle-in-cell simulations. After reaching the limit density, the plasma starts to blowout back toward the laser, and is accompanied by copious superthermal electrons; therefore, the electron energy can be determined by varying the laser pulse length.},

It is considered a promising technique for generating intense attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray wavelength ranges. However, a solid target used for the formation of the over-dense plasma is completely damaged by the interaction. Thus, it is challenging to use a solid target for applications such as time-resolved studies and attosecond streaking experiments that require a large amount of data. Here we demonstrate that high-harmonic radiation can be continuously generated from a liquid plasma mirror in both the coherent wake emission and relativistic oscillating mirror regimes. These results will pave the way for the development of bright, stable, and high-repetition-rate attosecond light sources, which can greatly benefit the study of ultrafast laser-matter interactions.},

  abstract = {We investigate the heating effects of high harmonics of an ultra-intense laser pulse, generated by the interaction of the pulse on an over-dense plasma mirror, incident on an aluminium target. In the regime where the Zero Vector Potential (ZVP) absorption mechanism dominates, the production of these harmonics is expected to be more efficient. Taking a well-established harmonic intensity scaling relationship from previous work, we use input specifications of the forthcoming ELI Beamlines laser facility and results from a complementary project to estimate the intensity-time profiles of the high harmonics. The radiative-hydrodynamic code Helios is then used to simulate the incidence of these high harmonics onto a tamped aluminium target. Here we define 'high harmonics' as being harmonics 15 and above of the fundamental incident laser pulse on the plasma mirror. Simulations of sequential pairs of harmonic orders in the range 15 to 46 yield two major results: the bulk aluminium target temperature can be driven to several keV when large ranges of harmonics are incident simultaneously, and the heating effect of a single pair of harmonics is much greater when the pair is incident alongside lower harmonics rather than in isolation. These results are encouraging for the use of harmonics as a heating source and warrant a further campaign of simulations to optimise the target setup and incident harmonic range ahead of potential experiments on current petawatt-class laser facilities.},

  abstract = {In this document, we provide: \textbullet{} A description of the experimental setup. \textbullet{} A derivation of the analytical formulas for the curvature of harmonic wavefronts, in the CWE and ROM harmonic generation regimes. \textbullet{} A detailed discussion on the comparison of the modeled and measured harmonic phase curvatures, and of the procedure used for this comparison. \textbullet{} Information on the Particle-In-Cell simulations performed to obtain the numerical results of Fig. 2 of the main text on the harmonic source size as a function of harmonic order. PHYCHOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT OF HIGH-ORDER HARMONIC BEAMS GENERATED ON PLASMA MIRRORS Experimental setup The measurements were performed at CEA Saclay using the UHI100 laser (100 TW, 25fs FWHM). As a very accurate control on the plasma expansion at the target surface is required, the temporal contrast is enhanced before the interaction using a double plasma mirror system, to reach values higher than 10 12 at times {$\tau$} {$>$} 10 ps before the main pulse. Two 1/2 inch diameter mirrors are inserted on the edges of the laser beam (3 inches diameter), in front of one of the large mirrors used to steer the main beam, in order to select two small parts of this beam and generate two prepulses focused on target at controllable delays {$\tau$} 1 and {$\tau$} 2 before the main pulse (typically a few picoseconds). These three pulses are focused on target using an off-axis parabolic mirror of focal length f = 500mm. As illustrated on Fig.S1 a, when {$\delta\tau$} = {$\tau$} 1 - {$\tau$} 2 = 0f s, the two prepulse beams interfere on the target surface. A slight variation in {$\delta\tau$} by a fraction of the laser period T L leads to a shift of the position of the fringes in this interference pattern. A larger variation, of a fraction of the pulse duration {$\tau$} L , changes the contrast of the interference fringes. The fringe spacing depends on the angle between the two focused prepulse beams: it is equal to d = 22\textmu m here. The maximum intensity on target of the prepulse beams focal spot is about 2.10 16 W/cm 2. The generated structured plasma, so-called transient plasma grating, then expends into the vacuum for a delay {$\tau$} d = 0.5({$\tau$} 1 + {$\tau$} 2), with a typical velocity of L/{$\tau$} d {$\sim$} 50 - 60nm/ps and depth of {$\delta$}L/L 20\%. This velocity is measured with the diagnostic described in [1], and the depth as described in [2]. As illustrated on Fig.S1 b, after a delay {$\tau$} d , the main beam impinges the transient plasma grating and drives high order harmonic generation. The control of the generation process is performed using a diaphragm of adjustable diameter: for the ROM mechanism, the whole beam is focused on target, leading to a focal spot (see Fig.S1 b) of waist w L = 6.2\textmu m and a maximum laser amplitude of a 0 1.5 - 2 at maximum laser power. For the CWE process, a 1-inch diameter diaphragm is introduced in the main beam before focusing, leading to a focal spot of waist w L = 14.5\textmu m and maximum laser amplitude of a 0 0.18 - 0.25.},

We show measurements of the bunch duration and temporal structure from particle-in-cell simulations. The experimental observation of such bunches favors specular reflection direction when focusing the laser pulse onto a subwavelength boundary of thick overdense plasmas at grazing incidence. Particle-in-cell simulation further reveals that the attosecond duration is a result of ultra-thin ({$\sim$} tenth of a micron) gaps of zero electromagnetic energy density in the modulated reflected radiation, while the bunching (locally peaked electron concentration) comes from the highly-directional electron angular distribution acquired by the electrons in a grazing incidence setup. To isolate a single electron bunch, we perform simulations using 1-cycle laser pulses and analyze the effect of carrier-envelop phase with particle tracking. The duration of the electron bunch can be further decreased by increasing the laser intensity and the focal spot size, while its direction can be changed by tuning the preplasma density gradient.},

Quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts that the properties of the fermionic quantum vacuum can be probed by extremely large electromagnetic fields. The typical field amplitudes required correspond to the onset of the 'optical breakdown' of this vacuum, expected at light intensities {$>$}4.7\texttimes 1029 W/cm2. Approaching this 'Schwinger limit' would enable testing of major but still unverified predictions of QED. Yet, the Schwinger limit is seven orders of magnitude above the present record in light intensity achieved by high-power lasers. To close this considerable gap, a promising paradigm consists of reflecting these laser beams off a mirror in relativistic motion, to induce a Doppler effect that compresses the light pulse in time down to the attosecond range and converts it to shorter wavelengths, which can then be focused much more tightly than the initial laser light. However, this faces a major experimental hurdle: how to generate such relativistic mirrors? In this article, we explain how this challenge could nowadays be tackled by using so-called 'relativistic plasma mirrors'. We argue that approaching the Schwinger limit in the coming years by applying this scheme to the latest generation of petawatt-class lasers is a challenging but realistic objective.},

  abstract = {We investigate the mechanism by which relativistic electron bunches created at the surface of a target irradiated by a very short and intense laser pulse transfer energy to the deeper parts of the target. In existing theories, the dominant heating mechanism is that of resistive heating by the neutralizing return current. In addition to this, we find that large amplitude plasma waves are induced in the plasma in the wake of relativistic electron bunches. The subsequent collisional damping of these waves represents a source of heating that can exceed the resistive heating rate. As a result, solid targets heat significantly faster than has been previously considered. A new hybrid model, capable of reproducing these results, is described.},

The seed source is designed to cover the energy range from 50 to 100 eV with a peak power of 400 kW and a 20 fs FWHM pulse length and is tuneable to provide continuous coverage over the full 50-100 eV range. The seed pulses are produced by HHG in rare gases in the loose-focusing regime, driven by a high-power kHz laser system. Continuous tunability is achieved by varying the wavelength of the drive laser over 25 nm from the 800 nm centre wavelength. Future prospects for increasing the HHG yield and short wavelength cut-off by using multi-wavelength generation schemes and longer drive wavelengths are considered, as is the potential for FEL seeding at higher repetition rates.\textcopyright{} 2011 Taylor \& Francis.},

Among the various schemes proposed for electrons, vacuum laser acceleration has attracted considerable interest and has been extensively studied theoretically because of its appealing simplicity: electrons interact with an intense laser field in vacuum and can be continuously accelerated, provided they remain at a given phase of the field until they escape the laser beam. But demonstrating this effect experimentally has proved extremely challenging, as it imposes stringent requirements on the conditions of injection of electrons in the laser field. Here, we solve this long-standing experimental problem by using a plasma mirror to inject electrons in an ultraintense laser field, and obtain clear evidence of vacuum laser acceleration. With the advent of petawatt lasers, this scheme could provide a competitive source of very high charge (nC) and ultrashort relativistic electron beams.},

The most promising of these are known as plasma mirrors, formed when an intense femtosecond laser ionizes a solid surface. These mirrors specularly reflect the main part of a laser pulse and can be used as active optical elements to manipulate its temporal and spatial properties. Unfortunately, the considerable pressures exerted by the laser can deform the mirror surface, unfavourably affecting the reflected beam and complicating, or even preventing, the use of plasma mirrors at ultrahigh intensities. Here we derive a simple analytical model of the basic physics involved in laser-induced deformation of a plasma mirror. We validate this model numerically and experimentally, and use it to show how such deformation might be mitigated by appropriate control of the laser phase. \textcopyright{} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the effects of ion motion on the generation of harmonics have only recently started to be considered. Here, we study the effects of ion motion in harmonics production at ultrahigh laser intensities interacting with solid density plasma. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we find that there is an optimum density for harmonic production that depends on laser intensity, which scales linearly with a{$<$}inf{$>$}0{$<$}/inf{$>$} with no ion motion but with a reduced scaling if ion motion is included. We derive a scaling for this optimum density with ion motion and also find that the background ion motion induces Doppler red-shifts in the harmonic structures of the reflected pulse. The temporal structure of the Doppler shifts is correlated to the envelope of the incident laser pulse. We demonstrate that by introducing a frequency chirp in the incident pulse we are able to eliminate these Doppler shifts almost completely.},

  abstract = {We use simulations to investigate the interaction of ultra-intense laser pulses with a plasma. With an intensity greater than 10' W/cm, these pulses have a pressure greater than l0 Mbar and drive the plasma relativistically. Hole boring by the light beam is a key feature of the interaction. We find substantial absorption into heated electrons with a characteristic temperature of order the ponderomotive potential. Other eAects include a dependence on the polarization of the incident light, strong magnetic field generation, and a period of intense instability generation in the underdense plasma. PACS numbers: 52.40.Nk, 52.35.Nx, 52.60.+h The ongoing development of ultrabright, short pulse lasers is allowing exploration of new regimes of laser-matter interaction. Experiments are now being carried out [1-3] in which plasmas are irradiated by laser light with intensities up to lk"=10' Wpm /cm. Here I is the intensity and A, " the wavelength in microns. At such intensities, electrons oscillating in the field of the light wave are strongly relativistic; i.e. , p, bmoc \textasciitilde{} I, where p" is the momentum of oscillation, mo the electron mass, and c the velocity of light. This is the first simulation study to address an ultra-intense light wave with a finite spot size normally incident onto an overdense plasma-vacuum interface. Some of the key results are strong hole punching and MeV ion generation inward due to the large light pressure, MeV electron generation into the overdense plasma by nonadiabatic heating at the sharp light-plasma interface, and estimates for the absorption of the incident light and characteristic temperature of heated electrons for a range of laser intensities soon to be experimentally accessible. We use a 2D, electromagnetic, relativistic electron, mobile ion, particle-in-cell code (ZOHAR [4]) to study this relatively unexplored, highly nonlinear regime [5]. As with previous ID studies at lower intensities [61, these simulations model the interaction of laser light with a col-lisionless plasma. For the intensities and time scales studied here, inverse bremsstrahlung is weak since the light-plasma interface is quite steep and the effective temperature of the electrons interacting with the light wave is large. We begin with a simulation which focuses on the interaction of high-intensity laser light with a preformed, overdense plasma. Laser light with a Gaussian intensity profile (in the transverse or y dimension) is introduced at the left boundary and propagates (in the x direction) through a region of vacuum onto a slab of overdense plasma. Particles escaping through the right boundary are reemitted with their original temperature. In this example , the system is 36c/cuit long in the x direction and 40c/coo wide, where roti is the light-wave frequency. The plasma is initially 22c/ton long, preceded by 14c/too of vacuum. The electric field of the incident light wave is in the y direction, and the dynamics are followed in the x-y plane (the so-called p-polarized case). In complementary simulations, the electric field is in the z direction (the s-polarized case). We consider both cases to provide insight into the three-dimensional aspects of the problem, which wi11 be a mixture of the two cases. The initial density of the plasma slab is 4n", where n" is the critical density for the incident wave. The initial electron temperature 8, is 4 keV, and the electron-ion mass ratio is 1/1836. The incident wave is turned on over 72taii ' and has a Gaussian transverse intensity profile with half-width of 14c/roti, with a peak intensity of 11"=1. 2\&\&10' Wpm2/cm2. This intensity corresponds to p,Jmtic =3. The intense, linearly polarized light wave strikes the overdense plasma and penetrates a thin layer somewhat larger than c/ ztodue to the relativistic mass change [7]. (Here to\textasciitilde{} is the electron plasma frequency.) Even for normal incidence, there is a very strong, high-frequency electrostatic field operating on the plasma in this interface. This field is simply the oscillating component of the ponderomotive force [8] fz, f\textasciitilde{} =V(y-I)mac, where y = (1+ p /mti) 'l and p is the electron oscillatory momentum in the transverse and longitudinal fields of the wave. Although generally nonresonant, this field can still accelerate electrons [9] which interact nonadiabatically with it in the steep interface. The frequency of the oscillating ponderomotive force is 2coo. This means that twice every cycle, a group of electrons will be accelerated into the plasma by this ponderomotive force. This will show up as a "train" of high-energy electrons, separated by a distance of half of a laser wavelength, or-trc/coti. The heating is apparent in Fig. 1(a), which is a snapshot of p" vs x of the electrons at topt =180. Figure 1(b) shows the energy spectrum of the heated electrons which have transported through the right boundary by coot =400. Note that these heated electrons have an effective temperature of about 1.1 MeV. At this time about 26\% of tke incident light-wave energy is being absorbed into these electrons. Boring of the light beam into the plasma is a very important feature of the interaction. The light pressure pL is extremely high; i.e. , pL, =2I/c-6X 10 Mbar for, say, I=10' W/cm. The hole punching is apparent in Fig 2(a), which is a snapshot of the ion charge density at coat =183. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the depth of the O\&},
